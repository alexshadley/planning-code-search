Dear Vitka Eisen: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding whether outpatient substance 
abuse and behavioral health services (dba HealthRIGHT 360) would be permitted on the ground floor of the 
property at 1016 Howard Street. In the Letter of Determination issued on March 14, 2013, which you enclosed 
with your request, HealthRIGHT 360 was defined as an Institutional Use: a social serve or philanthropic facility

The property at 1016 Howard Street is in the Mixed-Use General (MUG) zoning district and the SoMa Youth and 
Family Special Use District. Within the MUG district, the proposed use would be considered an Assembly and 
Social Service use per Planning Code Sections 840.34 and 890.50(a). An Assembly and Social Service use is

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not
