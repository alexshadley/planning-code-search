Dear Samuel Ray: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 721 Filbert Street, 
Lot  031  in  Assessor’s  Block  0101.  The  request  seeks  confirmation  that  the  building  can  change  from  a  Retail 
Automotive Use to a Retail Sales and Services Use, specifically a General Grocery Store, which occupies the same 
floor  area,  but  exceeds  the  use  size  limits  promulgated  in  Zoning  Control  Table,  without  conditional  use 
authorization. 

The subject property is located within the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD). Per Planning 
Code Section 121.2, any new nonresidential use size  of between 2,000 and 3,999 square feet within the North 
Beach NCD may only be approved through a Conditional Use Authorization (CUA). A new nonresidential use size 
of 4,000 square feet or greater in the North Beach NCD is not permitted. Per your request letter, the existing building 
contains a single Public Parking Garage use with a use size of approximately 9,800 square feet.  

The following Zoning Administrator interpretation of Planning Code Section 121.2 was issued in October 1993: 

This  Section  requires  a conditional  use  authorization for  uses  that  would  occupy more  than a  threshold 
amount of floor area. A conforming use which was over the threshold, but which predated the use size limit 
requirement could change to a different use occupying the same floor area without a conditional use

authorization as  long  as  there  was  no  significant  increase  in  the  floor  area.  See  Interpretations  186.1(b) 
"Significant" 12/88 and 10/93 for a determination of what constitutes "significant." 

However, Planning Code Section 178(e)(5) states the following: 

In  the  North  Beach  Neighborhood  Commercial  District,  any  use  that  exceeds  the  use  size  provisions  of 
Section 121.2(a)  or 121.2(b)  may  be  changed  to  a  new use only upon approval of a new conditional use 
application  [emphasis  added].  The  Commission's  approval  of  such  conditional  use  application  shall 
explicitly address the use size findings of Section 303(c). 

Therefore,  based  on  the  information  above  and  within  your  request,  the  specific  provisions  of  Planning  Code 
Section 178(e)(5) will require a CUA in order for the existing use size greater than 1,999 square feet to be changed 
to a new use, such as a Grocery Store. Please note that any such CUA must be granted pursuant to both Planning 
Code Section 303 and 780.3(c)(9).  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP
