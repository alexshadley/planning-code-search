Dear Mr. Forrestall: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1700 California 
Street. The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) the most up-to-date zoning information for the 
property; 2) whether Suite 570 is approved for an out-patient medical office use; and 3) if the current and 
planned use is already permitted by an approved Conditional Use Authorization (Case No. 82.224C - Planning 
Commission Motion No. 9791 - attached). 

In response to your request for up-to-date zoning information, the subject property is located within the RC-4 
(Residential-Commercial; High Density) Zoning District, Van Ness Special Use District, Van Ness Automotive 
Special Use District, and 80-D Height and Bulk District (as noted in the January 12, 2021 Zoning Verification Letter 
– attached).  

In response to your question as to whether Suite 570 is approved for an out-patient medical office use, such use 
appears to have first been established in Suite 570 under Building Permit Application No. 9405882 (offices of Dr. 
Fred Ostermann). This use is most recently documented in tenant improvements proposed under Building 
Permit Application No. 201912270850 (offices of Laurel Fertility Clinic).  

Planning Code Section 102 defines Health Service as: 

Service, Health. A Retail Sales and Service Use that provides medical and allied health services to the 
individual by physicians, surgeons, dentists, podiatrists, psychologists, psychiatrists, acupuncturists, 
chiropractors, or any other health-care professionals when licensed by a State-sanctioned Board 
overseeing the provision of medically oriented services. It includes a clinic, primarily providing

outpatient care in medical, psychiatric, or other health services, and not part of a Hospital or medical 
center, as defined by this Section of the Code.  

The use of the property as an out-patient fertility clinic (dba Laurel Fertility Clinic) is consistent with the 
definition of a Health Service.  

Pursuant to Planning Code Section 209.3 a Health Service is allowed with a Conditional Use Authorization in the 
RC-4 Zoning District above the ground floor. On August 18, 1983, the building at 1700 California was approved 
under Planning Commission Motion No. 9791 (Case No. 82.224C) as a Planning Unit Development (PUD) with 
retail, office, and residential uses. At that time, the property was located within the C-2 Zoning District, which 
allowed office uses (including medical office uses) as principally permitted uses. The approval and subsequent 
establishment of the Health Service use on the property pre-date the current zoning of the property, the current 
conditional use requirement, and even the current definition of Health Service.  

Based upon this information, it is my determination that the existing Health Service use of Suite 570 was lawfully 
established prior to the current requirement for a Conditional Use Authorization and may continue as a 
permitted Conditional Use per Planning Code Section 178(b).  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Scott F. Sanchez 
Acting Zoning Administrator
