Dear Joanne Park: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the continued operation of 
Navigation Centers at the three sites listed above. More specifically, once the current declared shelter crisis ends, 
will these Navigation Centers be legally established uses permitted to continue operations.  

Background 

The Board of Supervisors adopted Ordinance No. 057-16 on April 12, 2016, declaring a shelter crisis pursuant to 
California Government Code sections 8698 through 8698.2. The declared shelter crisis became effective on May 
22, 2016. Ordinance No. 213-16 became effective on December 4, 2016, and amended the Planning Code to 
allow temporary Homeless Shelters in certain districts. Ordinance 60-19 became effective on May 4, 2019, and 
reaffirmed the declared shelter crisis. As of the date of this letter, the declared shelter crisis is still in effect.  

Per Planning Code Section 210.3, Homeless Shelters require Conditional Use authorization to be established. 
However, footnote 19 to that section provides the following caveat:  

(19)  During a declared shelter crisis, Homeless Shelters that satisfy the provisions of California 
Government Code Section 8698.4(a)(1) shall be principally permitted and may be permanent  [emphasis 
added].  Otherwise, Homeless Shelter uses are permitted only with Conditional Use authorization and only 
if each such use (a) would operate for no more than four years, and (b) would be owned or leased by, 
operated by, and/or under the management or day-to-day control of the City and County of San 
Francisco.

Letter of Determination 
Multiple Properties 

If such a use is to be located within a building or structure, the building or structure must be either (a) 
preexisting, having been completed and previously occupied by a use other than a Homeless Shelter, or (b) 
temporary. Other than qualifying Homeless Shelters constructed during a declared shelter crisis, 
construction of a permanent structure or building to be used as a Homeless Shelter is not permitted. 

The specific language allowing Homeless Shelters to be “permanent” principally permitted uses if established 
during a declared shelter crisis was purposefully added by Ordinance No. 61-19, which took effect on May 5, 
2019. The Homeless Shelters at 125 Bay Shore Blvd, 1925 Evans Ave, and 600 25th St each received the 
appropriate authorizations and began operations during the current declared shelter crisis.  

Determination 

Based on the information above, it is my determination that the three separate Homeless Shelters referenced 
above are not subject to the 4-year operational limit of Planning Code Section 210.3 (footnote 19), but are 
instead considered to be permanent, principally permitted uses. As such, no additional Conditional Use 
Authorizations are required in the future to continue the operations of the subject Homeless Shelters.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
