Dear A. Gordon Atkinson: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1899 Green 
Street. The request seeks an interpretation of Planning Code Section 136(c)(25)(B)(ii) in relation to Building 
Permit Application No. 202205063679, which proposes to construct a rear horizontal addition to the existing 
building within the required rear yard. More specifically, you request confirmation that a 5-foot side setback is 
not required for the proposed “pop-out” obstruction on the side lot line fronting Laguna Street because that side 
lot line is not an “interior side lot line.”   

Planning Code Section 136 identifies permitted obstructions over streets and alleys and in required setbacks, 
yards, and usable open space. Planning Code Section 136(c)(25)(B)(ii) allows decks, and enclosed and 
unenclosed extensions of buildings (i.e., a “pop-out”) to extend no more than 12 feet into the required open area 
(i.e., rear yard), but prohibits them from occupying any space within the rear 25 percent of the total depth of the 
lot, or within the rear 15 feet of the depth of the lot, whichever is greater. A pop-out with a height of 10 feet or less 
from grade may cover the full lot width, with no required side setbacks. However, a pop-out with a height greater 
than 10 feet (but no higher than the floor level of the next floor of occupancy) “shall be no closer than five feet to 
any interior side lot line.”  

While the Planning Code defines Interior Lot and Corner Lot, the Code provides no additional context to the 
“interior side lot line” language of Section 136(c)(25)(B)(ii), and the illustration provided in the Code does not 
address a corner lot scenario. I conducted a review of current and historic Planning Code interpretations and 
documentation related to the adoption of the original pop-out provisions, and I also consulted with existing and

prior Planning Department staff on this distinction. I found no documentation related to this issue, and staff 
consultations (along with own experience) indicated that the Planning Department has historically interpreted 
and implemented Planning Code Section 136(c)(25)(B)(ii) such that the 5-foot side setback applies to all side lot 
lines, regardless of their interior or corner context.  

However, it is important to note that the Board of Supervisors adopted Ordinance No. 248-23 on December 12, 
2023, which will become effective on January 14, 2024. Among many other amendments within that ordinance 
aimed at allowing additional housing development, the ordinance amends Planning Code Section 134(h) to 
allow rear yards on corner lots in all applicable zoning districts to be substituted with an equivalent open area at 
the interior corner of the lot (subject to certain requirements), such that the building itself may fully wrap the 
corner and provide a consistent building wall along the front and side property lines. This amendment 
communicates a legislative intent to allow residential buildings to front street-facing side property lines when 
the interior of the lot is left open in a manner that adequately responds to adjacent interior lots and the mid-
block open space.  

Therefore, based on the combination of the plain language of Planning Code Section 136(c)(25)(B)(ii) and the 
newly adopted corner lot provisions of Planning Code Section 134(h), it is my determination that pop-outs 
permitted per Section 136(c)(25)(B)(ii) on corner lots must provide a 5-foot side setback only along an interior 
side lot line, and no side setback is required along a street-facing side lot line (e.g., the Laguna Street lot line for 
the subject lot at 1899 Green Street).  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
