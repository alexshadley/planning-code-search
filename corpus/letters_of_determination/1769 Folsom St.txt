Dear Juthamas Phakarat Singer: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the subject property (“TubTim 
Siam Thai Massage”), a three-story, residential-over-commercial building, located at 1769 Folsom Street. The 
Property is located in the PDR-1-G Zoning District and 58-X Height and Bulk District.  

Your request seeks to confirm whether an existing legally-authorized Sole Practitioner Massage Establishment 
use is permitted to expand into a Massage Establishment use at 1769 Folsom Street.  

Per Planning Section 102, a Massage Establishment is defined as follow:  

“a Retail Sales and Service Use defined by Section 29.5 of the Health Code. For purposes of the Planning 
Code only, "Massage Establishment" shall include both a "Massage Establishment" and a "Sole 
Practitioner Massage Establishment," as these terms are defined in Section 29.5 of the Health Code. The 
Massage Establishment shall first obtain a permit from the Department of Public Health, pursuant to 
Section 29.25 of the Health Code, or a letter from the Director of the Department of Public Health certifying 
that the establishment is exempt from such a permit under Section 29.25 of the Health Code.” 

A Sole Practitioner Massage Establishment is defined under Health Code Section 29.5 as follows:  

“a fixed place of business solely owned by a Massage Practitioner permit holder or CAMTC Certified 
Practitioner, which individual is the only person who provides Massage for Compensation. The business 
location may be shared by up to two Massage Practitioners or CAMTC Certified Practitioners in any 
combination, except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 29.29(e).”

Letter of Determination 
1769 Folsom Street 

Background 
On August 4, 2016, the Planning Department authorized a Sole Practitioner Massage Establishment use (dba 
Tubtim Siam) to operate on the first story of 1769 Folsom Street per Building Permit No. 201608044133. This 
permit was issued and completed on August 25, 2016, legally establishing the use. At that time, per Ordinance 
No. 73-15, the definition of Massage Establishment permitted a Sole Practitioner Massage Establishment with 
only the issuance of a building permit, and no Conditional Use Authorization was required.  

On May 26, 2017, Ordinance No. 105-17 took effect and amended the zoning controls for the PDR-1-G Zoning 
District to prohibit all Massage Establishment uses, including sole practitioner and chair massage uses per 
Planning Code Section 210.3. At that point, the subject Sole Practitioner Massage Establishment became a legal 
nonconforming use subject to the provisions of Planning Code Article 1.7.  

On March 3, 2020, Ordinance No. 63-20 took effect and amended the definition of Massage Establishment to 
remove the Conditional Use Authorization requirement for such uses that went beyond being a Sole Practitioner 
Massage Establishment  

Determination 
Although the existing zoning controls for the PDR-1-G-Zoning District do not currently permit a new Massage 
Establishment, the existing Massage Establishment at 1769 Folsom Street is a legal non-conforming use. 
Therefore, the existing Massage Establish use may be operated in a manner consistent with the current Planning 
Code definition of Massage Establishment, such as operating beyond a Sole Practitioner context, without the 
need for additional authorizations, such as a building permit or a Conditional Use Authorization. However, 
because the subject use is a legal nonconforming use, its ability to physically expand are subject to the 
provisions of Planning Code Article 1.7 and associated Zoning Administrator interpretations.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
