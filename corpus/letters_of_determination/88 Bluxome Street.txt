Dear Seth Socolow: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination (LoD) regarding the property at 88 Bluxome 
Street. The request seeks a determination as to whether the proposed revision to the project (“Project”) 
authorized by Planning Commission Motion No. 20493 (“Motion”) is a significant modification that requires a 
new authorization from the Planning Commission. The revision in question includes the elimination of the San 
Francisco Tennis Club facilities, consisting of 12 indoor tennis courts and other related space within the 
basement levels of the proposed building.  

On July 25, 2019 the Planning Commission approved a Large Project Authorization (per the Motion) for the 
Project, which would demolish the existing 288,570 square foot Bay Club SF Tennis Building and construct three 
new building components: West Component, East Component and Community Center/Affordable Housing 
Component. These three components would be constructed over a podium with two basement levels (with two 
mezzanines), extending down to approximately 65 feet below-grade. In total, the Project contains approximately 
1,197,290 gross square feet (gsf), including: 775,000 gsf of office, 134,460 gsf private recreation center (tennis 
club), 29,690 gsf community recreation, 16,590 gsf of retail, 8,080 gsf of Production, Distribution and Repair (PDR) 
use, and 4,630 gsf of child care. The Project will also include 15,500 square feet of privately-owned public space 
(POPOS). Additionally, the Project will provide 163 off-street parking spaces and 8 loading spaces, all accessed 
off Bluxome Street, 388 bicycle spaces (318 Class 1, 70 Class II), and 16 showers and lockers. During construction 
of the Project, the SF Bay Tennis Club would be relocated to an interim site in San Francisco, returning to the 
Project site once completed.

On June 16, 2020, Site Permit Nos. 201903215872, 201903215873, and 201903215884 were issued with a scope of 
work matching the project description in Motion No. 20493. On July 26, 2021, Site Permit Application Nos. 
202107265067, 202107265087, and 202107265105 were filed to revise the scope of the issued site permits to 
remove the basement levels previously approved to contain the SF Tennis Club Tennis Facility.  

Exhibit A of the Motion includes a standard section regarding “CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS” that states: 

“Changes to the approved plans may be approved administratively by the Zoning Administrator. 
Significant changes and modifications of conditions shall require Planning Commission approval of a new 
Large Project authorization.” 

As described in your letter, and in public hearings for the Project, the replacement of the SF Tennis Club Tennis 
Facility was the result of negotiations and private agreement between San Franciscans for Sports and Recreation 
and the property owner, and was a clear component of the Project. However, as further described below, such 
replacement was not a Planning Code requirement, a goal or objective adopted as part of the Central SoMa Area 
Plan, or a condition of approval of the Planning Commission’s authorization of the Project.  

Section 8 of the Motion details that per Planning Code Section 329(d), the Planning Commission may grant 
certain exceptions to the provisions of the Planning Code through a Large Project Authorization. Pursuant to 
Section 329(e), within the Central SoMa SUD, certain additional exceptions are available for projects on Key Sites 
that provide qualified amenities in excess of what is required by the Code. Qualified additional amenities that 
may be provided by these Key Sites include: affordable housing beyond what is required under Section 415 et 
seq.; land dedication pursuant to Section 413.7 for the construction of affordable housing; PDR at a greater 
amount and/or lower rent than is otherwise required under Sections 202.8 or 249.78(c)(5); public parks, 
recreation centers, or plazas; and improved pedestrian networks. 

Section 8 explains that the Project (a Key Site) goes beyond what is required by the Code in this regard, and 
would include four key amenities: 1) land that will be dedicated to the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community 
Development (MOHCD) for the development of 100% affordable housing; 2) a recreation and community center 
space (the "Gene Friend Aquatic Annex ") that is proposed for dedication to the City and operation by the 
Recreation and Park Department; 3) a block-long public park along Bluxome Street; and 4) the retention and 
replacement of the SF Bay Club Tennis Facility. 

Section 8 further explains that the first 3 amenities (and the POPOS) are specifically called for within the Central 
SoMa Area Plan as public amenities. However, the motion does not make such references to the replacement of 
the SF Bay Club Tennis Facility because the Central SoMa Area Plan does address its replacement at the site.  

Conditions Nos. 8 and 9 of the motion specifically require the land dedication to MOHCD for the development of 
100% affordable housing and the development of the community recreation center and its dedication to the San 
Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. However, the motion does not include a condition of approval 
requiring the replacement of the SF Tennis Club Tennis Facility within the Project.  

The SF Tennis Club Tennis Facility component of the project represents 11.2% of the total gross square feet in 
the project. However, it is entirely located within the basement levels of the proposed building. As such,

removing this component from the project has no impact on the Project’s massing or exterior design. 
Additionally, the removal also has practically no impact to the internal configuration of the project either, as the 
remaining Project components will continue to occupy their approved locations and layouts.  

Therefore, based on the information above, it is my determination that the removal of the SF Tennis Club Tennis 
Facility component of the Project as proposed in Site Permit Application Nos. 202107265067, 202107265087, and 
202107265105 is not a significant modification that requires Planning Commission approval of a new Large 
Project Authorization. Instead, the removal is a change that may be approved administratively by the Zoning 
Administrator. However, it is common practice for the Zoning Administrator to require project changes that are 
not significant, but are deemed otherwise to be of public interest, to require an informational presentation at the 
Planning Commission. It is important to note that this Project also received a variance from the Zoning 
Administrator (Case No. 2015-012490VAR). Therefore, Site Permit Application Nos. 202107265067, 202107265087, 
and 202107265105 may not be approved by the Planning Department until an informational presentation 
detailing the proposed Project revision is provided to the Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator at a 
joint public hearing. Such public hearing will allow an opportunity for public comment and feedback from the 
Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator before the site permits are approved and issued.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
