Dear Ms. Murphy: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at  3880 Jackson 
Street. The subject property is located in the RH-1 (Residential – House, One-Family) and 40-X Height and Bulk 
District.  The  request  seeks  confirmation  that  a  proposed  vertical  addition  complies  with  the  Planning  Code’s 
height requirements.  

Background 
As outlined in your request, the proposed vertical addition would add a fourth level with a dormer window that is 
setback substantially from the front building wall. The subject property is located within the RH-1 Zoning District 
on an upsloping lot with an average ground elevation at the rear lot line that is less than 20 feet higher than at the 
front lot line. The following is a summary of relevant Planning Code requirements for height.  

Per Planning Code Section 261(b)(1), the height limit for the subject lot is 35 feet based upon the zoning and lot 
conditions. 

Per Planning Code Section 260(a)(1)(C), height is measured from the average ground elevations at either side of 
the building and the ground elevations used shall be either existing elevations or the elevations resulting from 
new  grading  operations  encompassing  the  entire  block.  In  determining  the  existing  elevations,  the  Zoning 
Administrator may rely upon the pre-existing grade level at the time of construction as determined on a case-by-
case basis.

Letter of Determination

Per Planning Code Section 260(a)(2), height is measured to the highest point on the finished roof in the case of a 
flat roof, and the average height of the rise in the case of a pitched or stepped roof, or similarly sculptured roof 
form. 

Per  Planning  Code  Section  260(b)(1)(B)  the  top  10  feet  of  dormer  windows  are  exempt  from  the  height  limit 
provided they (along with any other feature listed in Planning Code Section (b)(1)) does not exceed 20% of the 
horizontal roof area upon which they are located. In effect, this means that a dormer window may extend up to 
10 feet above the height limit. To be considered a dormer window for purposes of the Planning Code, the feature 
must be designed in a manner such that the Zoning Administrator finds that it is subservient to the roof upon 
which it is located and would not be considered a separate roof form for purposes of height measurement.  

The initial Letter of Determination request was submitted on August 4, 2020; however, numerous supplemental 
responses  were  provided  to the  Planning  Department  in  response  to  comments  and  questions  regarding  the 
proposal.  

On March 22, 2021, you provided an updated analysis and plans to establish the ground elevations from which to 
measure height under Planning Code Section 260(a)(1)(C). These ground elevations rely upon a pre- existing grade 
along the west side of the building (as shown on a 2015 building permit) and an estimate of the pre-existing grade 
along the east side of the building  based upon the topography of the site. These plans measure height to the 
average height of the rise of the proposed fourth floor roof, which as a gable roof is a sculpted roof form under 
Planning Code Section 260(a)(2). 

On April 5, 2021, you provided a revised proposal for the dormer window that sets back the dormer from the edges 
of  the  roof  and  maintains  the  roof  form  on  sides  and  above  the  dormer  window.  Additionally,  the  proposed 
dormer is shown to be less than 20% of the area of the roof upon which it is located.  

Determination 
Based upon the information provided in your Letter of Determination request and supplemental responses (most 
notably submittals on March 22, 2021 and April 5, 2021), it is my determination that the revised proposal  for a 
vertical  addition  to  add  a  fourth  level  with  a  dormer  window  complies  with  the  Planning  Code’s  height 
requirements. As revised, the ground elevations comply with the requirements of Section 260(a)(1)(C), the roof 
form complies with the height measurement under Section 260(a)(2), and the dormer window complies with the 
requirements of Section  260(b)(1)(B). This review does not consider an evaluation of the proposal against the 
Planning  Department’s  Residential  Design  Guidelines.  Such  review  will  occur  during  the  review  of  a  building 
permit for the proposed addition. 

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not a permit 
to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be secured before 
work is started or occupancy is changed.
