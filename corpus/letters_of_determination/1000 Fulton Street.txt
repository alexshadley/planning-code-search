Dear M. Brett Gladstone, 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1000 Fulton 
Street. The request seeks confirmation of whether a Conditional Use Authorization (CUA) is required to remove 
approximately 9 off-street, surface parking spaces at the rear of the property in order to construct a new, 
detached Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) within the property’s required rear yard. 

According to our property records, the existing tourist hotel/bed and breakfast use was originally approved in 
1983 (under Motion No. 9617 for Case No. 82.663C) as a 15-guestroom hotel plus one manager’s unit. Condition 
No. 2 of Motion No. 9617 states the following: 

The Applicants shall provide the maximum number of off-street parking spaces (approximately 9 spaces) 
possible on the Subject Property after the proposed demolition of the existing dilapidated garage thereon) 
and shall use valet parking when necessary. Said off-street parking shall not occupy any required open 
area(s) on the Subject Property unless the Applicants seek, justify and are granted a variance from Code 
standards for same.  

Planning Code Sections 174 and 303(e) state that every condition, stipulation, special restriction, and other 
limitations imposed by administrative actions shall be complied with in the development and use of land and 
structures unless a new CUA is sought to modify any conditions imposed in a previously authorized Conditional 
Use. If off-street, accessory parking is required as a condition of approval of a CUA, other provisions of the

Planning Code may not be employed to reduce and/or replace such parking. Instead, the Planning Commission 
must grant a new CUA to amend or remove the previously adopted condition of approval.  

However, certain ADU proposals are eligible for ministerial consideration under state law. Government Code 
Section 65852.2(a)(3) provides that “A permit application for an accessory dwelling unit or a junior accessory 
dwelling unit shall be considered and approved ministerially without discretionary review or a hearing, 
notwithstanding Section 65901 or 65906 or any local ordinance regulating the issuance of variances or special 
use permits.”  State law governing ADUs also provides that “No other local ordinance, policy, or regulation shall 
be the basis for the delay or denial of a building permit or a use permit under this subdivision” (Gov. Code § 
65852.2(a)(5).  

Based on the information provided above, it is my determination that the existing off-street parking provided on 
the subject lot under Condition No. 2 of Motion No. 9617 may be removed to permit the construction of an ADU 
that qualifies for ministerial consideration under the state law referenced above (California Government Code 
Section 65852.2). This removal of parking may be approved administratively as part of the ADU building permit, 
and a new CUA will not be required.   

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
