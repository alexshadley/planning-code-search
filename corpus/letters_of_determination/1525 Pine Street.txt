Dear Nicholas Pigott: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1525 Pine Street. 
The request seeks confirmation of the applicable Performance dates in the conditions of approval as they 
pertain to the Conditional Use Authorization approval that was granted through Motion No. 20945 to the 
proposed project under Record No. 2015-009955CUA. 

The project at 1525 Pine Street under Record No. 2015-009955PRJ (“Project”) has the following procedural 
history that is relevant to the determination request above: 

1.  On January 27, 2021, a notice of determination that a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration 

(PMND) would be issued for the Project was duly published in a newspaper of general circulation in the 
City, and the PMND was posted on the Planning Department website and distributed in accordance with 
law. 

2.  On February 16, 2021, an appeal of the decision to issue a PMND was timely filed. 
3.  On May 6, 2021, the Planning Commission held a duly noticed public hearing on the appeal of the PMND, 
at which, testimony on the merits of the appeal, both in favor of and in opposition to, was received. At 
the conclusion of this hearing, the Planning Commission denied the appeal, affirmed the PMND, and 
published the Final Mitigated Negative Declaration (FMND), under Motion No. 20909 

4.  On July 22, 2021, the Planning Commission conducted a duly noticed public hearing on the application 
for Conditional Use Authorization under Record No. 2015-009955CUA. At the conclusion of this hearing, 
the Planning Commission approved the Conditional Use Authorization, with conditions, under Motion 
No. 20945. The Conditional Use Authorization constituted the “Approval Action” for the project for

purposes of Chapter 31 of the Administrative Code.  

5.  On August 20, 2021, an appeal of the Planning Commission’s adoption of the FMND was timely filed with 

the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. 

6.  On October 19, 2021, the Board of Supervisors held a duly noticed public hearing to consider the appeal 
of the FMND. At the conclusion of this hearing, the Board of Supervisors affirmed the approval of the 
FMND by the Planning Commission and denied the appeal. 

7.  On November 15, 2021, Planning Department staff made administrative corrections to Motion No. 20945 

and a corrected motion was issued under the same motion number. 

8.  On November 19, 2021, a Petition for Writ of Mandate under the California Environmental Quality Act 

and Other Laws was filed against the Project (“CEQA Lawsuit”). 

9.  On April 12, 2022, a Request for Dismissal of the CEQA Lawsuit was granted by the San Francisco County 
Superior Court (“Court”) with prejudice, and on April 27, 2022, the Notice of Entry of Dismissal was filed 
with the Court. 

As to the first part of this request, the effective date of Motion No. 20945 remains as July 22, 2021, 
notwithstanding the subsequent administrative correction made to this motion on November 15, 2021 and the 
procedural actions related to both the FMND appeal to the Board of Supervisors and the CEQA Lawsuit to the 
Court. 

As to the second part of the subject request, related to the Project’s Performance obligations listed under 
Condition Nos. 1 – 3 in Motion No. 20945, these are also not altered due to the procedural history above. As such, 
a site or building permit must be issued within 3 years of the date of the motion to avoid the need for the Project 
to come back to the Planning Commission for either extension or revocation. However, Condition No. 4 of this 
motion states: 

“Extension – All time limits in the preceding three paragraphs [Condition Nos. 1 – 3] may be extended at 
the discretion of the Zoning Administrator where implementation of the project is delayed by a public 
agency, an appeal or a legal challenge, and only by the length of time for which such public agency, 
appeal or challenge has caused delay.” 

As noted above, the Project was delayed due to an appeal and a legal challenge. More specifically, the Project 
was essentially in a state of appeal or challenge from its date of approval through the date of final action related 
to the legal challenge. This period spanned a total of 279 days between July 22, 2021 and April 27, 2022. 
Therefore, it is my determination that the 3-year performance period referenced in Condition Nos. 1 and 2 of 
Motion No. 20945 is extended for a total of 279 days due to appeal and legal challenge, resulting in a new 
performance period expiration date of April 27, 2025.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
