Dear John Kevlin: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 350 Brannan 
Street. Specifically, the request seeks confirmation that the existing use of the building is not a PDR use and is 
not subject to Proposition X (Planning Code Section 202.8).  

Permit and Use History 
Your request letter includes the building permit history of the building since its construction in 1929, which 
shows that the building was originally constructed as a two-story “industrial” building. In 1948, the second story 
mezzanine was expanded to be a full story, with a use of “store-offices-warehouse.”  In 1951, a second story 
mezzanine was expanded to be a full third story, with a building use of “light industrial.”  A 1956 building permit 
indicates four stories, but no subsequent permit recognizes four stories, and the existing building today only has 
three stories. Between 1969 and 1974, building permits indicated a building use of warehouse and workshop. 

A number of building permits have been issued since 1985 indicating a number of various uses, in particular: 

•

•

Building Permit (BP) No. 8503034 (1985) authorized tenant improvements for the building related to a
catering use. Both the “present use” and “proposed use” were indicated as “industrial catering.”  The
building permit was approved by the Planning Department.

BP No. 9016030 (1990) authorized tenant improvements on the second floor. Both the “present use” and
“proposed use” were indicated as “office.”  The building permit was not reviewed by the Planning

Department.

BP No. 9911901 (1999) authorized tenant improvements on the ground floor with a “present use” and
“proposed use” of “office.”  The building permit was approved by the Planning Department with the note
“As per application for tenant improvement and ADA (Title 23) upgrade to two restrooms. No other
work.”  Plans associated with the permit illustrate office tenant improvements on the ground floor.

BP No. 200002182256 (2000) revised BP No. 9911901 to include tenant improvements on the second and
third floors.  The “present use” and “proposed use” were indicated as “office.”  The scope of work also
included “No increase in office space.”  The building permit was approved by the Planning Department
with the note “As per plans and application to: Revise minor changes to bathrooms, kitchen and relocate
entrance door to meet code. No other work.”  Plans associated with the permit illustrate existing and
proposed office tenant improvements on the second and third floors.

Subsequent building permits issued between 2000 and 2010 all indicate a “present use” and “proposed use” of 
“office,” some of which were approved by the Planning Department, but none with respect to the legal use of the 
building. In 2020, BP No. 202008222445 was issued, authorizing tenant improvements on the ground floor, with 
the “present use” and “proposed use” indicated as “commercial,” approved by the Planning Department with the 
note “Interior TI only per plans. N/A.”   

You have provided Haines reverse directory listings for the building indicating numerous office tenants 
(including technology office) in the building since 1999.  

Zoning History 
The property’s zoning between its construction through 1989 permitted most commercial uses, including 
industrial and office uses. In 1989, the property was rezoned to the Service-Light Industrial (SLI) zoning district as 
part of the SoMa Mixed Use District rezoning. The SLI zoning district allowed many industrial and commercial 
uses but prohibited office use (with the exception of certain historic buildings and “workspace of design 
professionals,” which are not relevant to this Letter of Determination).  

The SLI zoning district did permit “business service” use, which included a grouping of multiple individual uses 
at the time, including “desktop publishing.” Several Letters of Determination from 1999 to 2001 concluded that 
the offices of certain technology companies were permitted in the SLI zoning district because they fit within the 
classification of “desktop publishing.”  As such, a number of technology company offices were legitimately 
established via building permit in various buildings in the SLI zoning district in 1999-2001. In 2001, a Planning 
Code amendment was enacted that eliminated “desktop publishing” from the definition of “Business Service” 
use, effectively reclassifying “desktop publishing” as an “office” use and prohibiting such use in the SLI zoning 
district moving forward.  

In 2016, Planning Code Section 202.8 was established pursuant to Proposition X, which was approved by the 
voters on November 8, 2016. In areas that were zoned SLI on July 1, 2016, any project that removes or converts 
5,000 square feet or more of PDR use must include replacement PDR space in the project at a ratio of 0.75 
square foot for every 1 square foot of PDR removed. Section 202.8 exempts any building that was subject to a 
conversion to PDR use commenced after June 14, 2016.

350 Brannan Street 

In December 2018, the Central SoMa Plan and associated rezoning was enacted, which rezoned the property to 
the Central SoMa Mixed Use-Office (CMUO) zoning district and the Central SoMa Special Use District. Most 
commercial uses are permitted in the CMUO zoning district, including General Office. 

Determination 
Generally, the legal use of an existing building is established through the issuance and completion of a valid 
building permit, or in any subsequent building permit that authorizes a change of use approved by the Planning 
Department. But if the permit history is unclear regarding the permitted use, a broader consideration of the 
totality of the circumstances is necessary, where evidence like historical City permitting practices, other official 
documents, tenant history, and other facts are considered to determine the existing, legal use of a building. In 
some circumstances, neither of these approaches result in a clear determination regarding the existing, legal use. 

Such is the case with the subject property. While it was originally constructed and expanded as an industrial use, 
subsequent building permits and tenant histories clearly indicate alternative uses in the building for the past 37 
years (approximately), despite the fact that there were no clear change of use permits issued. In 1985 and 
1999/2000, the Planning Department signed permits for tenant improvements at the property, but these permits 
listed the present and proposed uses being the same (“catering” and “office,” respectively).  

Therefore, based on the conflicting information described above, it is my determination that there is no legal use 
established at the subject property. A new permit is necessary to legally establish a land use, and such permit 
will be subject to all applicable Planning Code controls for that new use. Please note that because there is no 
legal use established on the subject property, establishment of a new use will not constitute the conversion of 
any use addressed by Planning Code Section 202.8, nor require replacement of any such uses.   

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
