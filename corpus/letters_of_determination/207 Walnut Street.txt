Dear David Armour: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 207 Walnut 
Street. The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) whether 207 Walnut Street can disregard 3401 
Washington Street (Block 0996, Lot 030) as an “adjacent property”  for purposes of Planning Code Sections 132 
(front setbacks), 134 (rear yards), and 261 (additional height limits). 

While 3401 Washington Street abuts 207 Walnut Street, it is a corner lot with frontage on Washington Street. 
Pursuant to Planning Code Section 132(d)(2),  if a lot abuts a property that front on another street, then the lot 
on which it so abuts shall be disregarded, and the required setback for the subject lot shall be equal to the front 
setback of the adjacent building on its opposite side.  In this case, 3401 Washington Street is disregarded, and 
the required front setback of 207 Walnut Street shall be equal to the front setback of 209 Walnut Street.   

Similarly, the building fronting on another street is  excluded for the purposes of measuring height and increases 
based upon conditions on adjacent lots.  Pursuant to Section 261(c)(2), the height limit shall be increased to the 
height of 209 Walnut Street as measured in the same vertical plane.

Letter of Determination 
207 Walnut Street 

In conclusion, only 209 Walnut Street would be considered as an adjacent lot or building for purposes of 
calculating front setback (Section 132) and height averaging (Section 261). With regard to rear yard setback, 
Planning Code Section 134 requires a 30 percent rear yard be provided; no reduction in the required rear yard via 
alternative method of averaging is allowed as the subject property is in an RH-1 Zoning District.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Tina Tam 
Acting Zoning Administrator
