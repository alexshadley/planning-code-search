Dear Lindsey Casillas, Esq.: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 91 Caselli 
Avenue. The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) whether the existing property was used as anything 
other than a single-family residence; 2) that it is ineligible for a lot split, and 3) that 93 Caselli Avenue does not 
exist in the Planning Department records. 

Planning Department records were reviewed and an Unauthorized Dwelling Unit Screening was conducted for 
the subject property. No documentation was found to indicate that the property contains more than one 
dwelling unit. The only exception is the Sanborn map from the 1990s, which lists the property as being a 2-family 
property labeled as 91-93 Caselli Avenue. However, Sanborn maps are created by a private company, were 
mainly for purposes of mapping building locations for fire insurance, and are not used to determine legal 
occupancies of buildings in San Francisco. But the Sanborn map from the 1950s lists the property with the single 
address of 91 Caselli Avenue. Finally, this feedback is based only on the documentation and information 
currently available and is only the feedback of the Planning Department. Please note that the Department of 
Building Inspection also has procedures regarding the legal number of dwelling units in a building (e.g., unit 
verification process and a Report of Residential Building Record – 3R).  

Regarding the ability to subdivide the subject lot, Planning Code Section 121 requires the subject lot to be a 
minimum of 2,500 square feet, have a minimum street frontage of 16 feet, and have a minimum width of 25 feet 
(for the area counting toward the minimum lot area). Because the existing lot has an area of 2,400 square feet 
and a width of 25 feet, the lot could not be split without a variance per Planning Code Section 305. However,

Letter of Determination 
91 Caselli Avenue 

Ordinance No. 248-23 was recently adopted by the Board of Supervisors and becomes effective on January 14, 
2024. That ordinance amended Planning Code Section 121 such that the minimum lot area will now be only 
1,200 square feet and the minimum lot width will now be only 20 feet. Any proposed lot split after that effective 
date will be subject to those new controls. However, a variance would still be required for any proposed lot split 
that does not meet all applicable quantitative controls of the Planning Code.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse of discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
