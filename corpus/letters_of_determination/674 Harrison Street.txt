Dear John Kevlin: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property 647 Harrison Street. 
The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) that a vertical addition to the building would not be subject 
to the 3:1 residential to non-residential ratio that applies to new construction in the MUR District; and 2) the legal 
existing use of the building is “laboratory” use and not subject to Planning Code Section 202.8 (Prop X). 

The residential to non-residential ratio mentioned in Planning Code Sections 803.9(a) and 841.09 apply only to 
new construction within the MUR zoning district. As you have stated in your determination request, a Planning 
Code interpretation issued by the Zoning Administrator in May 2009 titled “Housing Ratio in the MUR District” 
clarifies the difference between the terms “alteration” and “new construction.”  It specifically states the following: 

“The MUR District is intended primarily to be a residential district. Accordingly, this Section requires that 
three (3) residential gross square feet be created for every one (1) nonresidential gross square foot. This 
requirement was adapted from a similar requirement in the RSD District (Section 803.8(c)) which applies 
only to new construction. Section 803.8(d) inadvertently fails to specify the types of projects to which it 
applies. Because of this unintentional omission and because existing buildings could not reasonably be 
expected to meet this provision, this Section shall only apply to new construction and not to existing 
buildings.”

Letter of Determination 
674 Harrison Street 

As stated in your request letter, the Planning Code was subsequently amended by Ordinance No. 196-11 to add 
the clarifying “new construction” language to Section 803.9(a).  

The subject building at 674 Harrison Street was originally constructed in 1945 to house an industrial use through 
Building Permit (BP) No 84545. Subsequently, BP No. 8509599 was issued in 1985 and completed in 1986 to 
authorize a change of use from “office and warehouse” to “office and laboratory.” At the time, the lot was within 
the M-1 Zoning District, which principally permitted both an “Industrial or chemical research or testing 
laboratory” and an “experimental laboratory.” The reference to “light industrial” as the approved use (which was 
not a use category itself in 1985, or today) may be because the laboratory uses fell within the “Manufacturing and 
Processing” use group of the Planning Code (Section 226). The permit was approved by the Planning 
Department as a principal use in compliance with the M-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning District.  

While later permits did not consistently refer to the existing use as laboratory, those permits were typically for 
minor scopes of work that had no bearing on the use of the building. No subsequent building permits were ever 
issued to change the use, and the other permits typically included a note from Planning staff to the effect that 
Planning’s approval did not confirm or address the legal use of the lot.  

Planning Code Section 202.8 applies within the Mission, Eastern SoMa, Western SoMa, and Central SoMa plan 
areas. The specific replacement controls of Section 202.8(a) only apply to those lots within those area that were 
zoned SLI, SALI, MUG, MUR, MUO, or UMU as of July 1, 2016. However, these replacement controls only apply to 
existing PDR, Institutional Community, and Arts Activities uses.  

Based on the information above, it is my determination that the legal use of the subject lot at 674 Harrison Street 
is Laboratory, as defined in Planning Code Section 890.52, which is a principally permitted use in the MUR 
Zoning District. The Laboratory use was established through the issuance of BP No. 8509599 and its completion 
in 1986. As such, and despite falling within the geographical area affected by Planning Code Section 202.8 (Prop 
X), the replacement controls of Section 202.8(a) do not apply to the subject lot because there are no existing 
PDR, Institutional Community, or Arts Activities uses. Finally, a proposal to expand or alter the existing building 
would not be subject to the residential to non-residential ratio control of Planning Code Section 803.9(a), which 
would only be triggered by a proposal to demolish the existing building and construct a new building (aka new 
construction).  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not a 
permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be secured 
before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
