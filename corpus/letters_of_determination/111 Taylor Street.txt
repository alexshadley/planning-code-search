Dear Maria Richard:  

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 111 Taylor Street. 
This parcel is located in the RC-4 (Residential-Commercial, High Density) Zoning District, North of Market 1 
Residential Special Use District, and 80-XT-120T Height and Bulk District. You previously requested and received 
a written determination for this property on June 5, 2020. In that letter, you requested a land use determination 
regarding a work furlough program sponsored by the Federal government, which was determined to be a Group 
Housing use per Planning Code Section 102.  

The site is still used for a work furlough program sponsored by both State and Federal government contracts. 
The only difference in your current request is the distinction that the work furlough program may be sponsored 
by either or both the State or Federal government. As such, the use you describe is still a Group Housing use per 
Planning Code Section 102, regardless of whether it is sponsored by the State or Federal government, or whether 
it is privately operated. Group Housing is a principally permitted use in the RC-4 Zoning District, with a permitted 
density of up to one bedroom for every 70 square feet of lot area.  

Please note that should this use ever involve the provision of specialized aid to 7 or more residents by personnel 
licensed by the State of California (such as home for persons with psychological or addiction disorders) the use 
would be considered a “Residential Care Facility,” and such change of use would require a building permit to be 
filed, issued, and completed. A Residential Care Facility is now a principally permitted use per Section 209.3.

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call
