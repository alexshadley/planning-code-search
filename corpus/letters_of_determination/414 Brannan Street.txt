Dear Allan Low: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 414 Brannan 
Street. The request seeks confirmation that Epic Church, a non-denominational church with tax-exempt status, 
may use the subject property to hold religious services and conduct ancillary functions without requiring a 
Conditional Use Authorization. 

Planning Code Section 102 defines a Religious Institution as follows: An Institutional Community Use with tax-
exempt status as a religious institution granted by the United States Government and that is used primarily for 
collective worship or ritual or observance of common religious beliefs. Institutional Community Use is a 
subcategory within the broader Institutional Use category. 

The subject property is located in a Central SoMa Mixed Use Office (CMUO) Zoning District. According to Planning 
Code Section 848, all Institutional Uses are principally permitted up to 25,000 gross square feet per lot. These 
uses may exceed 25,000 gross square feet per lot provided the ratio of other permitted uses to retail is at least 
3:1. 

The subject property is also located within the Central SoMa Special Use District. The Central SoMa Special Use 
District does not address Institutional Uses. Active Uses are required at the ground floor for the first 25 feet of 
building depth and on ascending floors for the first 15 feet of building depth. Institutional Uses are generally 
considered Active Uses, provided they do not require non-transparent walls.

Therefore, a Conditional Use Authorization is not required to establish a Religious Institutional Use at the subject 
property. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.

Sincerely, 

Tina Tam 
Acting Zoning Administrator
