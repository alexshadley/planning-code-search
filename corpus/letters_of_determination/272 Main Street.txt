Dear Aaron Foxworthy: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding your request to release and 
terminate the Notice of Special Restrictions (NSR) encumbering the property located at 272 Main Street 
(recorded May 17, 2001 as Document No. 2001-G948432).  

On December 7, 2000, the Planning Commission conditionally approved (by Motion Nos. 16048 and 16049 – 
Application No. 1999.300BX) a proposed office development project on the Property sponsored by Abbassi 
Properties (“Abbassi Project”). Abbassi Properties recorded the NSR as required by that approval. 

Subsequent to the Commission's approval in 2000, the Board of Supervisors approved the Redevelopment Plan 
for the Transbay Project Area, which changed the principally permitted use of the Property to be a public park 
and new street right-of-way. In 2008, Abbassi Properties sold the Property to the Transbay Joint Powers Authority 
(“TJPA”). 

On March 9, 2009, the project’s representative (Tuija Catalano) submitted a letter to the Zoning Administrator 
stating the project was no longer active and the 46,500 square feet of office space could be returned to the Office 
Development Annual Limit Program (enclosed). On March 16, 2009, the Zoning Administrator issued a letter in 
response to administratively revoke the 46,500 square feet of office space allocated per Motion No. 16049

(enclosed). Additionally, Building Permit Application No. 200502185810 to construct the office building was 
cancelled on March 19, 2009 and the building was never constructed.  

Motion No. 16048 included Condition 2E that described the required performance period for the overall project 
authorization. However, it tied the performance period directly to the 18-month performance period required of 
the office allocation. As such, the administrative revocation of the office allocation was also a de facto 
administrative revocation of the project authorization.  

In January 2021, TJPA transferred the Property to the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII) 
to facilitate OCII's redevelopment of the Property as part of a public park (Transbay Park) and street right-of-way 
(extension of Clementina Street) in accordance with the Transbay Redevelopment Plan. Ultimately, OCII will 
convey the Abbassi Property and these improvements to the City.  

Based on the above, it is my determination that the subject project is no longer active, and the project approvals 
granted by Motion Nos. 16048 and 16049 have been revoked. As such, the associated NSR (Document No. 2001-
G948432) recorded on the property is moot. A Release of Notice of Restrictions may be provided by the Zoning 
Administrator and recorded on the property to nullify the restrictions of NSR Document No. 2001-G948432.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP

RE:

272 Main Street
Planning Commission Approval of Office Space
Motion No. 16049 - Case No. 1999.300B
Assessor's Block 3739, Lot 006

Dear Ms. Catalano:

Thank you for your letter (dated March 12, 2009) regarding the status of the office project at 272
Main Street.

On December 7, 2000, the Planning Commission authorized an office project consisting of up to
46,500 gross square feet of new offce space at 272 Main Street (Case No. 1999.300B - Motion No.
16049). On February 18, 2005, Building Permit Application No. 200502185810 was submitted to
erect a six-story office building on the subject site; however, this permit was not diligently
pursued by the Project Sponsor. On December 15, 2008, Building Permit Application No.
200811136470 was issued to allow demolition of an existing building to make way for the property
to be used as part of the Temporary Terminal Project for Transbay. On February 26, 2009,

Building Permit Application No. 200502185810 was cancelled/disapproved by the Central Permit
Bureau.

As stated in your letter "the project is no longer active." Further, your letter indicates that "the
46,500 sf office allocation can be returned to the Office Development Annual Limit Program."
Because the previously approved office space was not built, and your letter clearly indicates the
project is no longer active and the office allocation can be returned to the Annual Limit Program, I
hereby revoke the office project authorization granted by Motion No. 16049.

Should you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact Scott Sanchez at

(415) 558-6326 or scott.sanchez(gsfgov.org.

If you believe that this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or
abuse of discretion by the Zoning Administrator, an appeal may be filed with the Board of
Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter. For information regarding the appeals process,
please contact the Board of Appeals located at 1650 Mission Street, # 304, San Francisco, CA 94103,
or call (415) 575-6880.
