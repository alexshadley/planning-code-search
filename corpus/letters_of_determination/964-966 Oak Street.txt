Dear Saki Bailey: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 964-966 Oak 
Street. The request seeks confirmation that the property may have ten (10) residents occupying the building, 
each with individual leases. 

BACKGROUND 
On February 9, 2017, the Planning Commission approved a request for Conditional Use Authorization (Motion 
No. 19850, enclosed) to legalize the conversion of the property from a two-family dwelling to a Group Housing 
use. Group Housing is defined in Planning Code Section 102 as “a Residential Use that provides lodging or both 
meals and lodging, without individual cooking facilities, by prearrangement for a week or more at a time, in a 
space not defined by this Code as a dwelling unit. Such group housing shall include, but not necessarily be 
limited to, a Residential Hotel, boardinghouse, guesthouse, rooming house, lodging house, residence club, 
commune, fraternity or sorority house, monastery, nunnery, convent, or ashram.” Neither the Planning Code nor 
Motion No. 19850 regulate the number of leases allowed for the property. Motion No. 19850 authorizes the 
subject property to operate a group housing use with seven bedrooms containing a total of ten beds.  

DETERMINATION

number of individual leases allowed between the property owner and tenants, provided that the seven bedroom

and ten bed maximums are observed. Specific to the request for a Letter of Determination, ten individual leases 
are allowed. Every individual lease must be for an initial term of at least seven days or more, in conformity with 
the Group Housing use definition. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Tina Tam 
Acting Zoning Administrator
