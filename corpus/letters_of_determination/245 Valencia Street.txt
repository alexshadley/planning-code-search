Dear Robert Bernstein: 

This letter serves as a Letter of Determination (LoD) regarding the property at 245 Valencia Street regarding the 
proposed development project (“Project”) submitted under Building Permit (BP) No. 201008038065 to construct 
a 2-story religious worship building. This LoD is intended to provide confirmation on 1) the impact fees 
applicable to the project; and 2) the date of “final action on the project approval that assesses the requirement” 
pursuant to Planning Code Section 406(a)(2). 

The Project (Case No. 2010.0681) was to construct a new 2-story cathedral building with below grade off-street 
parking for the Annunciation Greek Orthodox congregation. The congregation has worshipped on this property 
since at least 1989 when they used the Valencia Theater for services. Following damage from the 1989 
earthquake, the Valencia Theater was condemned, and the congregation moved into an adjacent building for 
services. The Valencia Theater was demolished, and the congregation constructed a Fellowship Hall in its place, 
which was then used for services once finished. The temporary adjacent building used for services between the 
Valencia Theater and Fellowship Hall locations was then proposed for demolition, with the subject permit and 
cathedral as the replacement building on that portion of the site. 

The subject building permit was first approved by Planning on October 12, 2012, and then subsequently re-
approved on October 7, 2013, just prior to the permit’s final issuance on October 17, 2013. At the time of permit 
issuance, Planning staff assessed two development impact fees for the permit: 1) the Transit Impact 
Development Fee (TIDF) pursuant to Planning Code Section 411 in the amount of $176,105.30; and 2) the Market 
& Octavia Community Infrastructure Fee (MOCIF) pursuant to Planning Code Section 421 in the amount of 
$49,712.01 .

Impact fees are calculated at issuance of the first building or site permit and  due to be paid at the issuance of 
the first construction document. Because BP No. 201008038065 was submitted as a full building permit and not 
a separate site permit with subsequent addenda, the issued building permit was the first construction 
document. However,  the Development Fee Collection Unit (DFCU) at the Department of Building Inspection 
(DBI) did not provide the project sponsor with a Final Development Impact Fee Report for this permit, nor were 
the impact fees collected prior to permit issuance on October 17, 2013. It was only toward the end of 2021, when 
the project was attempting to obtain Certificates of Occupancy, that DBI flagged that there were unpaid impact 
fees for this permit. 

Since that time, the Church has filed and been granted a Charitable Exemption from the TIDF, pursuant to 
Planning Code Section 411.8. Therefore, the project’s only remaining impact fee is the MOCIF, totaling 
$49,712.01. Because this impact fee should have been collected in 2013, no subsequent indexing of this fee will 
occur for the years 2014-2022. 

Following issuance of this LoD, the DFCU will issue the project sponsor a Final Development Impact Fee Report. 
For purposes of Planning Code Section 406(a)(2), because the project sponsor was not provided with a Final 
Development Impact Fee Report in 2013 prior to building permit issuance, it is my determination that the 
forthcoming issuance of the Final Development Impact Fee Report for BP No. 201008038065 shall constitute the 
“final action on the project approval that assesses the requirement,” pursuant to that section. The project 
sponsor would therefore have 15 days following issuance of the Final Development Impact Fee Report to file an 
appeal of the impact fee with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors based upon “the absence of any reasonable 
relationship or nexus between the impact of development and the amount of the fee charged.” 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
