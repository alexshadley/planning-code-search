Dear Gerrie Teo: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 81 Frank Norris 
Street (Unit 504). The request seeks confirmation that Unit 504 is not subject to an age-related restriction. 

BACKGROUND 
In 2002, the Planning Department approved Building Permit Application No. 2002.05.03.5712 for construction of 
32 senior housing units at 1314 Polk Street (aka 81 Frank Norris Street), doubling the allowable density in the 
Polk Street NCD Zoning District under an exception in Planning Code Section 207.4(b) for projects “specifically 
designed for and occupied by senior citizens or physically handicapped persons.” The permit was issued on 
January 14, 2003, and the description of work on the building permit stated “senior housing units, introduction 
of additional floor of occupancy, reductions to retail [square feet], remove exterior modifications to façade 
throughout.” 

At the time of approval in 2002, the Planning Code did not require a conditional use authorization for such 
projects, and so there were no Planning Commission-adopted conditions of approval for the project. Allegedly 
on the advice of its counsel, the developer (1314 Polk Street Associates, LLC) proceeded under the mistaken 
belief that only 80% of the units needed to be occupied by persons 55 years of age or older. The developer 
recorded a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs), which stated that “[t]he 
Development is a senior housing project, and it is intended that at least eighty percent (80%) of the residential 
condominium units will be occupied by at least one (1) qualifying senior citizen,” defined in the CC&Rs as a 
person at least 55 years old (CC&Rs Document No. 2007-I450596, § 2.1(a).) But in a different section of the same

document the CC&Rs also stated that “[e]ach Residential Unit shall be occupied by at least one (1) qualifying 
senior citizen.” (Id., § 7.1(e).)  

In November 2007, two months after the CC&Rs were recorded, the developer executed and later recorded an 
amendment to the CC&Rs, deleting section 7.1(e) in its entirety, explaining that the section was from a 
preliminary draft and had been inadvertently included in the final version. (First Amendment of the CC&Rs, 
Document No. 08-I563807.) Neither the CC&Rs nor the amendment identified specific residential units to which 
the age restrictions were intended to apply. Even as amended, the CC&Rs reflect an incomplete account of the 
applicable federal and state law regarding senior housing developments. 

In November 2007, five years after approval of the building permit, the Planning Department received an 
anonymous complaint that units in the condominium building were not being marketed to seniors or disabled 
persons, and that some of the units were unlawfully occupied by non-seniors. This complaint provoked the City 
to bring an enforcement action against the developer that resulted in a Notice of Violation (NoV), which the 
developer appealed to the Board of Appeals on the basis that the development needed only restrict 80% of the 
units for senior housing. On July 3, 2008, following briefing and hearing, the Board of Appeals upheld the NoV 
and determined that all 32 units were subject to the age restriction. 

Following the Board’s decision, the Planning Department attempted to work with the homeowner’s association 
and individual owners to bring the building into compliance over time, due to the fact that some owners had 
already purchased their units. On July 7, 2011, the Department issued notices to all property owners instructing 
them to record a Notice of Special Restrictions (NSR) to provide constructive notice to future buyers of the 
occupancy restriction. While some owners voluntarily recorded NSRs, many did not. The Planning Department’s 
records reflect that 19 of the 32 units have recorded NSRs to date. An NSR (Document No. 2011- J234439) was 
recorded for Unit 504 on August 8, 2011. In February 2020, the Planning Department closed enforcement cases 
for those condominiums that had not recorded NSRs. 

In response to the issues that arose regarding this project, the City amended the Planning Code so that to qualify 
as a “Senior Housing” project an NSR must be recorded with the Assessor-Recorder that clearly states the 
property’s senior occupancy restriction, and condominium projects must also provide the Planning Department 
with a copy of the project’s Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (Planning Code Sec. 202.2(f)(1)(D)).  

Recently, litigation between Jyothsna Talkad, et al. (Plaintiff) and 1314 Polk Street Owners Assoc., et al. 
(Defendant) has moved forward (San Francisco Superior Court Case Number CGC-18-563635), resulting in your 
and others’ request for a written determination on these issues from the Zoning Administrator. In response, an 
updated analysis of the restrictions is provided below.  

LEGAL ANALYSIS 

Occupancy restrictions based on age must be recorded to be enforceable. 
State law requires that conditions of permit approval that restrict an owner’s ability to convey real property, such 
as the senior housing restrictions at issue here, must be recorded against the property to be enforceable. (Gov. 
Code, § 27281.5.) Government Code Section 27281.5(a) provides:

Letter of Determination 
81 Frank Norris Street (Unit 504) 

Any restriction imposed upon real property on or after January 1, 1982, which restricts either the ability of 
the owner of real property to convey the real property or the owner of a proprietary leasehold interest to 
convey such interest and which is imposed by a municipal or governmental entity on real property or a 
proprietary leasehold interest which is not owned by the municipal or governmental entity, shall be 
specifically set forth in a recorded document which particularly describes the real property restricted in 
order to impart constructive notice of the restriction, or shall be referenced in a recorded document which 
particularly describes the real property restricted and which refers by page and book number to a 
separately recorded document in which the restriction is set forth in full. 

(Gov. Code, § 27281.5(a) [emphasis added].) Accordingly, when a city imposes a restriction limiting an owner’s 
ability to convey real property, the restriction must be specifically and fully set forth in a recorded document 
particularly describing the real property to which it applies, and further, the restriction “shall be valid and 
enforceable only when the requirements [regarding recordation] have been met.” (Id., § 27281.5(a), (c).) 

To satisfy Government Code Section 27281.5, the restriction must be properly recorded in the chain of title. (See 
Far West Savings & Loan Assn. v. McLaughlin (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 67, 73 [“wild” documents that cannot be 
located by searching the “grantor” and “grantee” indices of the public records do not impart constructive 
notice].) But the recorded restriction need not take any particular form as long as it meets the requirements of 
Section 27281.5(a). For example, a properly recorded subdivision map that includes the property restriction 
likely satisfies section 27281.5(a). (See Estenoz v. City and County of San Francisco (Feb. 24, 2009), SF Superior 
Court No. CGC-07-469460.) A senior housing restriction that sets a minimum age requirement for occupancy is a 
restriction on the owner’s ability to convey the property, and therefore, must be recorded against the property. 
(1119 Delaware v. Continental Land Title Co. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 992, 999.) 

The City may not enforce the age restriction. 

The senior housing requirement is not recorded. 
The 81 Frank Norris Street project did not require a conditional use to authorize its double-density when it was 
approved in 2002 and there is no set of restrictions recorded against the property that specifically sets forth any 
lawful age restriction on occupancy. While the project’s recorded final subdivision map includes the phrase 
“senior housing” in its title block (without any further explanation), the notation would not likely satisfy the 
requirement under Section 27281.5 to fully or “specifically set forth” the restriction on occupancy. Moreover, the 
passage of time—more than 10 years—since discovery of the violation has made enforcement untenable since 
any applicable statute of limitations has expired, as explained below. 

Each owner acquired a condominium only subject to the recorded restrictions at the time of purchase, which did 
not include the City’s senior housing restriction. Without a recorded restriction, there is no relationship between 
the City and the subsequent purchasers, who are not subject to the obligations of the developer. The City cannot 
enforce an unrecorded senior housing restriction against a subsequent owner who had no constructive notice of 
the restriction or has no contractual relationship with the City. Even if the subdivision map supported an 
argument for enforcement, opportunity to enforce expired nearly a decade ago. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 336(b) 
[five-year limitations period from time of discovery for violation of a restriction or limitation on the use of real 
property in a deed, declaration, or other instrument].) 

The CC&Rs do not set forth an enforceable senior housing restriction.

Other than the voluntarily recorded NSRs, there is only one recorded document that contains any age restriction 
on occupancy: the CC&Rs. The City is not a party to the CC&Rs and does not have a right to enforce them. 
Additionally, the CC&Rs also do not satisfy the requirements of Section 27281.5, because they do not fully or 
specifically set forth the age restriction that would apply to a project of this size. 

The CC&Rs purport to restrict occupancy to those 55 years of age and older, but the project is not large enough 
to qualify for the 55-year age restriction. Under state law, a “‘[q]ualifying resident’ or ‘senior citizen’ means a 
person 62 years of age or older, or 55 years of age or older in a senior citizen housing development.” (Civ. Code, § 
51.3(b)(1).) Among other requirements, a “senior citizen housing development” must have at least 35 dwelling 
units. (Id., § 51.3(b)(4).) With only 32 units, 81 Frank Norris Street does not qualify as a “senior citizen housing 
development.” Accordingly, the only age restriction that could lawfully apply to the facility is the 62-year 
restriction. The CC&Rs omit this age restriction and instead attempt to impose a lower age restriction 
inconsistent with fair housing laws. Consequently, the restriction is not enforceable. Under the Unruh Civil Rights 
Act, covenants, conditions, and restrictions or other written policies are enforceable only to the extent permitted 
by the Act, “notwithstanding lower age restrictions contained in those documents or policies.” (Civ. Code, § 
51.3(g); see also, Gov. Code, § 12956.1(b)(1) [requiring county recorder’s notice that restrictions that violate state 
and federal fair housing laws are void].) 

A second problem with the CC&Rs is that they do not clearly describe the restricted real property with the 
particularity required to impart constructive notice, as required by Government Code Section 27281.5(a). The 
CC&Rs state that only 80% of the units must be occupied by a qualifying senior citizen, but do not identify 
specific units to which the occupancy restriction applies. While a recorded restriction that generally applies to an 
entire subdivision need not specifically describe each lot or unit within the subdivision, here, the CC&Rs imply 
the restriction is not applicable to the entire subdivision, but fail to identify the specific units to which it does 
apply. (See Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 
1356, 1375.) 

Subsequently recorded NSRs do not exempt 81 Frank Norris Street from fair housing laws. 
While owners of 19 of the 32 units at 81 Frank Norris Street voluntarily recorded NSRs against their properties, the 
NSRs are not enforceable because individually and collectively, they do not qualify 81 Frank Norris Street for an 
exemption from fair housing laws prohibiting discrimination based on age or familial status. 

The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 prohibits discrimination on the basis of “familial status,” meaning 
housing providers may not deny housing or limit the terms, conditions, or privileges of housing for people with 
children. (42 USC §§ 3602(k), 3604.) But the federal law establishes an exemption for “housing for older persons,” 
which permits providers to restrict housing to senior citizens. (42 USC § 3607(b)(2).) Under the federal exemption, 
“housing for older persons” includes housing that is (a) “intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years 
of age or older; or” (b) “intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per 
unit,” provided the housing meets specified requirements. (Ibid.) For the “62 and older” restriction, every 
occupant must be at least 62 years of age, with limited exceptions for employees of the housing facility and the 
families of employees who perform substantial duties directly related to the management or maintenance of the 
housing. (24 C.F.R. § 100.303(a)(3).) For “55 and older” communities, at least 80 percent of the occupied units 
must be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. (24 C.F.R. § 100.305.)

Letter of Determination 
81 Frank Norris Street (Unit 504) 

California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on numerous bases including 
familial status and age, through incorporation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act in Civil Code Section 51. (Gov. Code, § 
12955(d).) The Unruh Civil Rights Act (the “Act”) prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing based 
upon age, but similar to the federal law, establishes an exception for housing “designed to meet the physical and 
social needs of senior citizens.” (Civ. Code, § 51.2.) Under the Act, a “senior citizen” is a person 62 years of age or 
older, or 55 years of age or older in a “senior citizen housing development,” defined as a residential development 
for senior citizens with at least 35 dwelling units. (Civ. Code, § 51.3(b).) While certain non-senior qualified 
residents may be permitted to occupy senior housing under state law, at a minimum, the age restriction “shall at 
least require that the persons commencing any occupancy of a dwelling unit include a senior citizen who 
intends to reside in the unit as his or her primary residence on a permanent basis.” (Civ. Code, § 51.3(c).) The 
exemption for senior housing under the Unruh Civil Rights Act is more restrictive than the federal exemption “in 
recognition of the acute shortage of housing for families with children in California.” (Civ. Code, § 51.4(a).) 

The only lawful age restriction that could apply to a project of fewer than 35 units, such as 81 Frank Norris Street, 
is the restriction requiring all occupants of all units to be at least 62 years old. Unlike the federal exemption for 
housing for people 55 years of age and older—which allows up to 20% of the dwelling units to be occupied by 
non-seniors—the restriction for people 62 years and older requires the housing to be “solely occupied” by 
persons at least 62 years old, and any unoccupied units must also be reserved for occupancy by qualifying senior 
citizens. (42 USC § 3607(b)(2); 24 C.F.R. § 100.303(a).) The only exception under federal law is for employees of the 
housing facility who manage or maintain the housing. (24 C.F.R. § 100.303(a)(3).)  

Likewise, State law requires every new occupancy to include a qualifying senior citizen who intends to reside in 
the unit as his or her primary residence. (Civ. Code, § 51.3(c).) Thus, individual condominiums may not be 
exempted from the fair housing laws, rather, the entire facility must be age-restricted. (24 C.F.R. § 100.304 [“A 
portion or portions of a single building shall not constitute a [senior] housing facility or community.”]; see also, 
Assem. Com. on Housing & Community Development, Analysis on Sen. Bill No. 1818 (2003–2004 Reg. Sess.) June 
15, 2004 [“no part of a housing development can be restricted to seniors unless the (entire) housing 
development qualifies for the senior housing exemption of state and federal fair housing law.”].) 

While an NSR or collection of NSRs that specifically set forth a lawful occupancy restriction for all of the 
building’s dwelling units may be enforceable, the NSRs for only a portion of 81 Frank Norris Street are not. 
Accordingly, an attempt to enforce the age restriction or refusal to sell or rent units at 81 Frank Norris Street to 
individuals based on age could constitute unlawful discrimination. Unless all units restrict occupancy to persons 
62 years of age and older in accordance with state and federal law, there is no enforcement path for only a 
portion of the total units. 

DETERMINATION 
Based on the history and updated analysis described above, it is regretfully my determination that, despite the 
fact that the additional density at 81 Frank Norris Street was achieved through a provision of the Planning Code 
that required the units be age-restricted, the Planning Department may not legally enforce senior occupancy 
restrictions at 81 Frank Norris Street (Unit 504) because such action would violate the California Government 
Code. As detailed in the analysis above, this inability to legally enforce the age restriction is primarily due to the 
lack of constructive notice recorded for all of the units before individual units were sold. The Planning 
Department’s inability to enforce applies to Unit 504 despite the fact that an NSR was subsequently recorded to 
document the age restriction for the unit.
