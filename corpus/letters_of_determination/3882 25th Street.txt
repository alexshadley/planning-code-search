Dear Lauren Hill : 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 3882 25th Street. 
The subject property is located within the RH-2 (Residential- House, Two Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height 
and Bulk District. The subject lot is approximately 1,816 square feet (23.75 feet wide by 76.5 feet deep) and is 
occupied by a two-story over basement, single-family residential building constructed in 1915. 

The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) whether a pre-existing 1-story rear building projection may 
be considered a legal non-complying structure; and 2) whether “fill-in” under the rear 1-story portion of the 
building could be exempt from neighborhood notice, 3) whether a basement floor development must meet the 
requirements of Zoning Administrator Bulletin No. 1 (aka Rooms Down), 4) whether the existing deck could be 
rebuilt under the provisions of Planning Code Section 136(c)(24)(a), and 5) whether a neighborhood notice 
would be required to expand the existing garage under the existing terrace with no expansion of the opening to 
the street.  

The rear yard requirement is not correctly depicted within the enclosed existing plans. Planning Code Section 
134 requires a property in the RH-2 Zoning District to maintain a rear yard equal to 45 percent of the lot depth, or 
approximately 34 feet 5 inches for the subject property. The 45% rear yard may be reduced by a means of 
averaging. Planning Code Section 134(c)(4)(B) states:  

“In the case of any lot that abuts along one of its side lot lines upon a lot with a building that fronts on 
another Street or Alley, the lot on which it so abuts shall be disregarded, and the forward edge of the

required rear yard shall be reduced to a line on the subject lot which is at the depth of the rear building 
wall of the one adjacent building fronting on the same Street or Alley.” I 

Planning Code Section 134(e)(3) states:  

“…an ”adjacent building” shall mean a building on a lot adjoining the subject lot along a side lot line. In all 
cases the location of the rear building wall of an adjacent building shall be taken as the line of greatest 
depth of any portion of the adjacent building which occupies at least one-half the width between the side 
lot lines of the lot on which such adjacent building is located, and which has a height of at least 20 feet 
above grade, or two Stories, whichever is less.”  

As such, the rear yard per averaging is equal to the qualifying depth of the adjacent building on Lot 23, which is 
approximately 26 feet 9 inches based on the plans you provided.  

Based on the City Assessor's Records, the residential building has approximately 1,641 square feet of floor area, 
contains two bedrooms, and was constructed circa 1915. Aerial photographs from 1938 appear to show a small 
addition at the rear, but the exact size and shape of such addition is unclear. Sanborn maps from 1950 and mid 
1990s also show a 1-story rear addition, although it appears slightly smaller on the Sanborn maps than what 
currently exists. Building Permit No. 201003259019 was issued on March 26, 2010 to remodel the kitchen, which 
is located within the 1-story rear addition. DBI did not determine the 1-story rear addition to be unpermitted as 
part of that permit review. However, it is unclear if the work permitted was ever completed, as DBI conducted 
only one inspection and the permit expired on February 6, 2012.  

The plans for Building Permit No. 201003259019 also showed the rear deck and stairs in a configuration where 
the stairs ran perpendicular to the rear of the building, running to the north. Based on areal photography 
through SFGIS IPA (Integrated Pictometry App), the rear deck and stairs were either replaced or reconfigured 
sometime between May 2012 and September 2013 such that the stairs run to the west, parallel to the rear 
building wall. There is no building permit filed or issued for this property to replace or reconfigure the rear deck 
and stairs. Additionally, none of the historic Sanborn maps show a rear deck and stairs.  

The Zoning Administrator interpretation for Section 134 issued in June 1990 and Revised in March 2021 
regarding fill-ins under nonconforming projections states: 

"It is an established policy to allow the enclosure of the void under a legal nonconforming enclosed 
projection extending into the required rear yard. Noting that a fence could not exceed a height of 10 feet, 
this policy could not be applied to a situation where the void extends higher than 10 feet above existing 
grade at any point. Such void could not be enclosed without a variance."  

A portion of the Zoning Administrator interpretation for Section 311 issued in April 1996, and further 
documented in Zoning Administrator Bulletin No. 4, states the following: 

“‘General rule’ exemption: Anything not visible from any off-site land or structure is exempt from the Section 
311 notification except that which constitutes a "change of use" which Section 311 includes in the definition

of an "alteration" subject to this Section. See interpretation 101.1(e) 9/93 for when an addition of a dwelling 
unit constitutes a change of use.” 

On March 22, 2021 the Zoning Administrator repealed Zoning Administrator Bulletin No. 1 - Developing Ground 
Floor Accessory Rooms in Residential Buildings (aka Rooms Down) and adopted a new interpretation to better 
define kitchens within Dwelling Units.  

Planning Code Section 136(c)(24)(A) states: 

“(24)   Decks, whether attached to a building or not, at or below the adjacent first floor of occupancy, if 
developed as usable open space and meeting the following requirements: 
         (A)   Slope of 15 percent or less. The floor of the deck shall not exceed a height of three feet above grade 
at any point in the required open area, nor shall such floor penetrate a plane made by a vertical angle 45 
degrees above horizontal with its vertex three feet above grade at any lot line bordering the required open 
area,” 

The plans and photos submitted with your request depict a deck and stairs within the required rear yard at 
height greater than 3 feet. Additional information is required to determine if a proposed deck replacement 
would meet the provisions of Planning Code Section 136(c)24(a).  

The existing garage is located within an existing portion of the building, the roof of which is used as a terrace. 
Planning Code Section 311(b)(2) states:  

“Alterations. For the purposes of this Section, an alteration shall be defined as an increase to the exterior 
dimensions of a building except those features listed in Section 136(c)(1) through Section 136(c)(24) and 
136(c)(26).”   

Planning Code Section 136(c)(27) further regulates garages within the required front setback, and states:   

“Garages, where the average slope of the required open area ascends from the street lot line to the line at 
the setback and exceeds 50 percent, provided the height of the garage is limited to 10 feet above grade, or 
the floor level of the adjacent first floor of occupancy on the subject property, whichever height is less;”  

The plans provided do not indicate if the property and garage meet the criteria of Sec. 136(c)(27), although aerial 
photographs suggest that the original average slope of the front setback may exceed 50 percent. If so, the ceiling 
height of any garage expansion would be limited to 10 feet above grade.  

DETERMINATION 
Based on your submittal and the information above, it is my determination that: 

1.  The existing 1-story rear addition is a legal noncomplying building unless determined otherwise by the 
Department of Building Inspection. However, there is no record of the rear deck and stairs as they 
previously existed. Additionally, the rear deck and stairs were replaced or reconfigured in 2012/2013 
without the benefit of a building permit. As such, a building permit is needed to legalize the rear deck 
and stairs. If the rear deck and stairs are more than 3 feet above grade, then a rear yard variance is also

required to legalize.

2.  Expanding the basement level to fill in the crawl space beneath the existing 1-story rear addition would 
not require neighborhood notification per Planning Code Section 311 and would not require a rear yard 
variance per Planning Code Section 305.  

3.  Zoning Administrator Bulletin No. 1 (aka Rooms Down) is now repealed and therefore would not apply to 

any proposed work at the basement level. Such work will be subject to all other relevant Planning Code 
controls when a permit is filed.  

4. 

If the rear deck and stairs are replaced in a manner consistent with Planning Code Section 136(c)(24)(a) -
i.e. no higher than 3 feet above grade – such a scope of work would not require neighborhood 
notification per Planning Code Section 311 and would not require a rear yard variance per Planning 
Code Section 305. 

5.  Expanding the garage within the existing building envelope, and consistent with any other application 
Planning Code controls, would not require neighborhood notification per Planning Code Section 311 
and would not require a rear yard variance per Planning Code Section 305. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
