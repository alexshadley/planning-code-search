Dear Chloe Angelis: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 543 Howard 
Street and 48-50 Tehama Street. The request seeks confirmation whether the proposed project is eligible to 
pursue a tower separation exception pursuant to Planning Code Section 132.1(d)(2)(B). 

Planning Code Section 132.2(d)(1) sets forth requirements for the separation of towers in C-3 Districts. 
Subsection (d)(2) sets forth exceptions that may be granted by the Planning Commission in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 309. Subsection (d)(2) outlines three separate provisions for projects to be eligible for an 
exception to the tower separation controls per subsections (A), (B), and (C). 

Your request focuses specifically on Planning Code Section 132.1(d)(2)(B), which states: 

Exceptions may be allowed to the extent that it is determined that restrictions on adjacent properties make it 
unlikely that development will occur at a height or bulk which will, overall, impair access to light and air or the 
appearance of separation between buildings, thereby making full setbacks unnecessary. The minimum 
setback for such facades shall be partially or fully reduced as appropriate by the Planning Commission as an 
exception according to the procedures of Section 309 for any of the following conditions: 

(i) For lots on Assessor's Blocks 3719, 3720, and 3721 which have property lines that directly abut the
Transbay Transit Center or directly face it across Minna or Natoma Streets.
(ii) For development lots abutting preservation lots that have transferred all potential development rights
according to the procedures of Section 128.

Letter of Determination 
543 Howard Street and 48-50 Tehama Street 

This Planning Code section was amended to add the last sentence of the main paragraph and the two 
subsections (i) and (ii) per Ordinance 182-12, which was adopted to implement the Transit Center District Plan.  
The additional language clarifies specific examples when the Planning Commission shall consider an exception 
to the tower separation requirements, as these are clear examples within the Transit Center District where there 
are restrictions on adjacent properties that make development unlikely. This language does not otherwise affect 
or alter the remaining language in Subsection (B).  

Based on the information provided in your request and the relevant text of the Planning Code, it is my 
determination that Planning Code Section 132.1(d)(2)(B) applies to any project that is subject to the tower 
separation controls of Section 132.1, and does not include any other eligibility thresholds like those found in 
Subsections (A) and (C). Therefore, the Project is eligible to pursue a Planning Commission exception to the 
tower separation controls of Planning Code Section 132.1 through the provisions of Sections 132.1(d)(2)(B) and 
309. This determination does not address the Project’s merit for receiving such an exception, which is subject to
Planning Commission review and discretion.

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
