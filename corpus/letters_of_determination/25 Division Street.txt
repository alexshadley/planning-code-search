Dear Toby Levy: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the permitted uses at 25 Division 
Street. The Property is located in a PDR-1-D (Production, Distribution, and Repair- 1- Design) Zoning District and 
58-X Height and Bulk District.  

Per your request, you are seeking clarification and/or confirmation of the following: 

1.  Whether lot line adjustment(s) are permitted at lots 3912/001 and 3912/003 per Planning Code Sections 

121 and 121.9;  

2.  Whether ground floor PDR and upper-story Office uses are permitted within two separate buildings 

reviewed simultaneously in separate applications submitted to the Planning Department;  

3.  Whether a Midblock Alley of 20 feet is required per Planning Code Section 270.2; and  

4.  Whether a 17-foot Minimum Ceiling Height is required at the first and second floors for PDR uses per 

Planning Code Section 145.5. 

Lot Line Adjustment 
Planning Code Sections 121(d)(2) and (e)(2) require a newly created lot to have a minimum width of 25 feet and 
minimum area of 2,500 square feet, respectively. The proposed lot line adjustment would meet these minimum 
standards. However, Planning Code Section 121.9 requires a Conditional Use Authorization for “any proposal to 
subdivide, resubdivide, or perform a lot line adjustment to a parcel that is equal to or greater than 10,000 square

feet, into one or more smaller parcels” within a PDR District. The proposed project includes a lot line adjustment 
that will reduce Lot 3 from approximately 32,000 square feet to 21,000 square feet within a PDR District. 
Therefore, the lot line adjustment will require a Conditional Use Authorization subject to the criteria of Planning 
Code Section 121.9.  

PDR and Office Use 
The request seeks confirmation that a project could develop 22,800 gross square feet (gsf) of PDR use and 45,600 
gsf of Office use on each lot following the lot split. The PDR use category includes many different individual uses. 
Table 210.3 in Planning Code Section 210.3 lists which uses are principally permitted, conditionally permitted, or 
not permitted. While many PDR uses are principally permitted in the PDR-1-D Zoning District, some are 
conditionally permitted or not permitted.  

Office use is not permitted in a PDR-1-D Zoning District unless it is within a designated Landmark building, and 
then it requires Conditional Use Authorization. The subject properties do not contain a designated Landmark 
building and therefore are not eligible for this provision. However, Planning Code Section 210.3C permits a 
limited amount of Office uses in the PDR-1-D Zoning District when such use will subsidize the construction of 
new PDR space on parcels that are largely vacant or substantially underutilized. Per Planning Code Section 
210.3C, eligible parcels must meet all of the following criteria:  

1.  Are located in either the PDR-1-D or PDR-1-G Districts; 

2.  Are located north of 20th Street; 

3.  Contain a floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.3 gross floor area or less as of January 1, 2014; and 

4.  Are 20,000 square feet or larger. 

The subject lots are located within PDR-1-D, are north of 20th Street, and both resulting lots would be larger than 
20,000 square feet. However, while no information was provided in the request related to the FAR of the lots, data 
from the City Assessor and other sources indicate that as of January 1, 2014, and continuing today, the subject 
properties are developed with structures having near full lot coverage and a FAR greater than 0.3. Therefore, the 
subject parcels would not be eligible to establish Office use through the provisions of Section 210.3C because 
the lots do not meet all of the required eligibility criteria.  

Midblock Alley 
Planning Code Section 270.2 requires midblock alleys for “all new construction on parcels that have one or more 
street or alley frontages of over 200 linear feet on a block face longer than 400 feet between intersections, and 
are in the C-3 Districts, if located south of Market Street, or in the South of Market Neighborhood Commercial 
Transit District, Folsom Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District, Regional Commercial District, Eastern 
Neighborhoods Mixed Use Districts, or DTR Districts, except for parcels in the RH DTR District, which are subject 
to Section 827.” The subject properties are not located within any of the above listed districts. Therefore, a 
midblock alley is not required for any project proposed at 25 Division Street.

Minimum Floor to Ceiling Height 
Planning Code Section 145.5 requires all new buildings constructed in Industrial Districts to provide “ground 
floor spaces with a minimum floor-to-floor height of 17 feet, as measured from grade”. It’s important to note that 
Planning Code Section 201 describes the “Industrial Districts” classification to only include the M-1 and M-2 
Districts and not PDR Districts, including the PDR-1-D District. However, Section 145.5 was created per Ordinance 
No. 298-08 as part of the original Planning Code amendments to implement the Eastern Neighborhoods Area 
Plans. Planning Code Section 201 was subsequently amended in 2013 (Ord. No. 56-13) to separate the Industrial 
and PDR Districts classifications. However, there is clear documentation in the record that there was no intent to 
remove PDR Districts from the controls of Section 145.5. Therefore, any new construction on the subject lots 
must have a minimum ground floor height of 17 feet (floor-to-floor, as measured from grade). Regarding any 
minimum floor height for the 2nd floor, the Planning Code does not regulate floor heights above the ground floor. 

Process 
Your request also asked for information regarding the process going forward, and if the two projects (one on 
each lot) could be reviewed simultaneously. However, considering the Planning Code does not permit Office use 
on the subject lots, this letter cannot provide any specific guidance on the process required for any alternative 
proposals. Additionally, two adjacent lots under the same ownership may be developed as separate 
developments so long as the lots together do not meet the definition of a “Lot” per Planning Code Section 102, 
which may include such adjacent lots if the “combination is necessary to meet the requirements of this Code.” 
Other matters of development review process are generally not dictated by the Planning Code and are instead 
subject to Department discretion and any other applicable local and state laws.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
