Dear Mr. Hillyard: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at  300 Page Street 
(known as the San Francisco Zen Center). The subject property is in the RTO (Residential Transit Oriented) Zoning 
District and 40-X Height and Bulk District. The request seeks to confirm whether a 1974 Hotel Permit of Occupancy 
would allow the San Francisco Zen Center to rent up to five guest rooms on a short-term basis. 

Background 
The San Francisco Zen Center, a 501(c)(3) under the Federal Tax Code, has owned and operated the facility at 300 
Page Street, known as the Beginners Mind Temple, since approximately 1968. Based upon the Assessor’s records, 
the building was constructed in 1922 and is used for “Churches, Convents, Rectories.” 

On April 19, 2002, the San Francisco Zen Center submitted Building Permit Application (BPA) No. 200204194495 
(see  attached)  with  the  following  project  description:  “TO  CORRECT  CITY  RECORDS,  ACTUAL  USE  IS  GROUP 
HOUSING, RELIGIOUS ORDER SINCE 1968.” The permit lists the  existing and proposed  use as “Group Housing, 
Religious Order” with a Building Code Occupancy of “R-1” and a unit count of “49 + 1 GR” (guest room). No plans 
were filed with the permit. 

On May 6, 2002, the Planning Department approved the permit with the following note: “Per code section 209.2(b): 
Group  housing,  religious  orders  permitted.  No  construction/alteration  work  proposed.”  Then  Planning  Code 
Section 209.2(b)1 (Group Housing, Religious Orders) is a principally permitted use under both the current zoning 

1  209.2(b)  Group  housing,  religious  orders:  “Providing  lodging  or  both  meals  and  lodging,  without  individual  cooking  facilities,  by 
prearrangement for a week or more at a time and housing six or more persons in a space not defined by this Code as a dwelling unit, where 
such housing is for members of a religious order calling for collective work or worship and is not defined as or on the same lot as a religious 
institution  as  defined  and  regulated  by  Section  209.3(j)  of  this  Code.  Such  housing  shall  include  but  not  necessarily  be  limited  to  a 
monastery, nunnery, convent and ashram. The density limitations for group housing, by district, shall be as set forth in Section 208 of this 
Code”. Note, this definition is no longer active, as it is found as Group Housing in Section 102 of the present Code.

designation of the property (RTO Zoning District) and the one in effect at the time of permit approval (RM-2 Zoning 
District).  

On May 21, 2002, the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) issued the permit; however, it subsequently expired.  

On May 9, 2014, the San Francisco Zen Center sought and received BPA No. 201405095409 (see attached) to renew 
BPA No. 200204194495 for Final Inspection.  

On June 20, 2014, DBI documented the completion  BPA Nos. 200204194495 and  201405095409 to correct City 
records and document the use of the property as Group Housing.  

It is noted that BPA No. 201405095409 differed from the first by listing a Building Code Occupancy of “R-2” (instead 
of R-1) and omitting “+ 1 GR” (guest room). While the occupancy classification is under the Building Department’s 
jurisdiction,  and  not  subject  to  Zoning  Administrator’s  interpretation,  R-1  includes  “Congregate  residents 
(transient)  with  more  than  10  occupants”  and  R-2  “Congregate  residences  (non-transient)  with  more  than  16 
occupants” as well as “Monasteries” and “Convents.” It is our understanding that the San Francisco Zen Center 
primarily operates a residential practice with rooms starting with a 1-week stay. This is consistent with the Planning 
Code’s definition of Group Housing, which requires a minimum stay of 1 week. It is also our understanding that 
DBI had been conducting Residential Hotel Survey Form inspections prior-to the two permits to document the 
group housing use, and the Assessor reports no income from tourist hotels for 300 Page Street in recent years. The 
lone  guest  room  listed  on  the  2012  permit  but  omitted from  the  2014  permit  is  assumed  to  be  an  accidental 
omission. 

Determination 
Based  upon  available  information  (including  the  permit  history),  the  subject  property  is  authorized  for  group 
housing and is not authorized as a Hotel use. The 1974 Permit of Occupancy cannot be construed to authorize a 
Hotel use on the property given this record. The permit history indicates that at most one guest room (from the 
2002 permit) could be presumed to exist. If it does exist, it may be rented on a short-term (less than 1-week) basis 
without further Planning process. It is recommended that a new permit to clarify the differences between the two 
permits  be  sought  through  DBI  (with  review/approval  by  the  Planning  Department).  This  would  confirm 
occupancy as R-2 (from the 2014 permit) and the correct room count at 49 with the one guest room (from the 2012 
permit) to ensure that an accurate record is maintained. 

Pursuant to Planning Code Section 209.4, a Conditional Use Authorization (CUA) is required to establish or expand 
a Hotel use with a total of 5 or fewer guest rooms or suites of rooms. A Hotel with six or more guest rooms is not 
permitted on the subject property. A CUA cannot be granted through a Letter of Determination and must be sought 
from the Planning Commission. More information on the CUA process can be found on the Planning Department’s 
website. 

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
