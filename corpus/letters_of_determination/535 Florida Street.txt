Dear Andrew A. Bassak: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 535 Florida Street. 
This  property  is  located  in  the  UMU  (Urban  Mixed  Use)  Zoning  District  and  68-X  Height  and  Bulk  District.  The 
request seeks a determination related to the Planning Department’s previous processing of permits for the subject 
property, specifically responses to the following questions: 

1) Did  the  Planning  Department’s  failure  to  publish  a  Section  312  Notice  for  Building  Permit  No.

201210193467 violate the requirements of Planning Code Section 312?

2)

3)

If so, did the Planning Department’s failure to publish a Section 312 Notice invalidate the Department’s
approval of the Building Permit, such that the last legal use of the Property would be the restaurant use
that was legally authorized by Building Permit No. 9712891, No. 9815857, and No. 200408101072?

If  not,  how  was  the  change  of  use  effectuated  if  the  Building  Permit  was  approved  by  the  Planning
Department in violation of the Planning Code?

Background 
As noted in the Letter of Determination request, Building Permit (BP) No. 201210193467 resulted in a change of 
use from Restaurant to two separate principal uses: Catering and Other Retail Sales and Services. This permit was 
approved by the Planning Department on November 8, 2012, issued by the Department of Building Inspection 
(DBI) on November 13, 2012, and completed on March 6, 2013.

Letter of Determination 
535 Florida Street 

On January 22, 2020, the property owners submitted a request for a Letter of Determination (Record No. 2020-
001656ZAD) regarding the subject property. The January 2020 request sought a determination of the last legal use 
of the property, as well as whether a proposed use would be allowed. On February 24, 2020, a supplement to this 
request was submitted. 

On May 29, 2020, the Zoning Administrator issued a Letter of Determination finding that BPA No. 201210193467 
changed the previous Restaurant use to two separate principal uses: Catering and Other Retail Sales and Services. 
The determination also found that a proposed conversion to accessory cafeteria for a Laboratory on an adjacent 
lot  could  be  allowed.  However,  such  conversion  would  be  subject  to  the  PDR  replacement  requirements  of 
Planning Code Section 202.8. 

On June 15, 2020, the property owner appealed the Letter of Determination to the Board of Appeals (Appeal No. 
20-040).

While reviewing the appeal materials, the Planning Department found that BP No. 201210193467, which included 
a  change  in  land  use  category  from  Retail  Sales  and  Services  (Restaurant)  to  Industrial,  Home,  and  Business 
Service (Catering), did not receive official neighborhood notification pursuant to then-Planning Code Section 312. 
Given the change in land use category associated with BP No. 201210193467, Section 312 notification would have 
been required at that time. In reviewing this information, the Planning Department determined that such absence 
of notification did not invalidate BP No. 201210193467, work under which had been completed on March 6, 2013. 
The Planning Department informed the property owner’s attorney of this conclusion prior to the appeal hearing. 

On  February  17,  2021,  the  Board  of  Appeals  heard  Appeal  No.  20-040  at  a  duly  noticed  public  hearing.  At  this 
hearing, the Board was made aware that BP No. 201210193467 was approved without notification under Section 
312. However, the appellants did not argue, in their brief or at the hearing, that the lack of public notice for the
permit was grounds to overturn the Zoning Administrator’s determination regarding the legal use of the property.
Aware of the lack of notification under Section 312, the Board nevertheless upheld the Letter of Determination,
which  found  that  BP  No.  201210193467  changed  the  previous  Restaurant  use  to  two  separate  principal  uses:
Catering and Other Retail Sales and Services.

Determination 

1) Did  the  Planning  Department’s  failure  to  publish  a  Section  312  Notice  for  Building  Permit  No.

201210193467 violate the requirements of Planning Code Section 312?

At the time BPA No. 201210193467 was submitted, then-Planning Code Section 312 required neighborhood
notification for permits proposing a change in land use category. BP No. 201210193467 proposed a change
in land use category from Retail Sales and Services (Restaurant) to Industrial, Home, and Business Service
(Catering). Given this change in land use category, Section 312 notification would have been required at that 
time. However, official neighborhood notification under Section 312 was not provided.

2)

If so, did the Planning Department’s failure to publish a Section 312 Notice invalidate the Department’s
approval of the Building Permit, such that the last legal use of the Property would be the restaurant use
that  was  legally  authorized  by  Building  Permit  No.  9712891,  No.  9815857,  and  No.  200408101072?

Letter of Determination 
535 Florida Street 

Approval of BP No. 201210193467 without neighborhood notification under Section 312 was a procedural 
oversight,  but this  oversight  does  not  invalidate the  permit.  The  oversight  was  procedural  in  nature (i.e., 
limited to notification requirements) and did not impact the permit’s compliance with the Planning Code. 
The permit was consistent with the substantive requirements of the Planning Code. There is no evidence that 
the  property  owner  or  any  member  of  the  public  have  been  injured  by  the  lack  of  official  neighborhood 
notification associated with BP No. 201210193467, or that neighborhood notification would have resulted in 
a different outcome with respect to the City’s decision to grant the permit. To the contrary, the project sponsor 
relied upon the permit to legally establish the use, and work authorized by the permit was completed in 2013. 
The  subject  space  was  occupied  by  a  well-known  business  (Charles  Chocolates)  that  received  media 
coverage regarding its move to and operations at the subject property over the years. During this time, there 
is  no  record  that  any  complaint  was  filed  with  the  City  regarding  this  change  of  use  of  the  subsequent 
business operations. Additionally, members of the public had the right to file a Jurisdiction Request with the 
Board of Appeals after the permit appeal period expired to request a right to appeal the permit because the 
City  intentionally  or  inadvertently  caused the  requestor  to  be  late  in  filing  the  appeal.  However,  no  such 
request was ever filed with the Board of Appeals.  

3) 

If  not,  how  was  the  change  of  use  effectuated  if  the  Building  Permit  was  approved  by  the  Planning 
Department in violation of the Planning Code?  

The change of use was effectuated under BP No. 201210193467 because the scope of work outlined in the 
permit complied with the substantive requirements of the Planning Code, the permit was relied upon to 
legally establish the use (with work completed in 2013), and the use operated under benefit of the permit 
for many years without complaint. The lack of notification under Section 312 was a solely procedural 
oversight. There is no evidence that the property owner or any member of the public were injured by the 
lack of official neighborhood notification associated with BP No. 201210193467, or that neighborhood 
notification would have resulted in a different outcome with respect to the City’s decision to grant the 
permit. 

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
