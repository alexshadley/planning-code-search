Dear John Kevlin: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 2270 McKinnon 
Avenue. The request seeks confirmation that the legal, existing use of the property for Planning Code purposes is 
a Private Parking Lot use. 

Building Permit Application (BPA) No. 349036, issued on January 19, 1968, authorized construction of a 5,600-
square-foot “storage and office” building on the site and the BPA No. 350099, issued on January 19, 1968, 
authorized construction of another 450-square-foot “parts storage” building. The permit applications for both 
buildings identified the owner as Keller’s Freight  Lines. 

Looking into the Department’s record, a separate permit application was submitted in 1988 for the business 
named “Consolidated Freightway” where trucks used in conducting the business were stored on-site. On 
January 9, 1989, the Planning Department determined that no Conditional Use Authorization (CUA) is required 
to continue the existing use as a “truck terminal facility” even though establishing such use at the time would 
trigger a CUA “because it has been in existence 20 years without compliant. DJS (Dan Sullivan, Chief of 
Neighborhood Planning) ruled in a staff meeting that we should allow the use to continue.”  

Per Planning Code Section 102, the “truck terminal facility” use would be classified as a “Private Parking Lot”, 
which is defined as “A Non-Retail Automotive Use that provides temporary off-street parking accommodations 
for private automobiles, trucks, vans, bicycles, or motorcycles on an open lot or lot surrounded by a fence or wall 
not open to the general public, without parking of recreational vehicles, motor homes, boats, or other vehicles, 
or storage of vehicles, goods, or equipment.”

The subsequent miscellaneous permit applications, No. MB0200038, MB0501217, and MB0501267 for National 
Cab Company, Inc., appears to be related to the buildings onsite for automobile repairs in repair garages. Given 
that there’s no evidence that the automobile repair service were open to the general public, the use would be 
considered as an accessory use to the Private Parking Lot use.  

The subject property is located in PDR-2 Zoning District and the Industrial Protection Zone SUD, which requires 
permitted land uses to be governed by the M-1 and M-2 Zoning Districts. Because the subject property is zoned 
PDR-2, its permitted land uses are governed by the M-2 Zoning District. The site is currently used as a surface 
parking lot for National Cab, a taxicab company.  Alongwith the two accessory structures on the property, it is my 
determination that the legal use is a a Private Parking Lot use. Even though establishing a new Private Parking 
Lot use requires a CUA in the M-2 Zoning District per Planning Code Section 210.4, no CUA is required to continue 
the existing use as a Private Parking Lot. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Tina Tam 
Acting Zoning Administrator
