Dear Richard Drury: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination, representing the Waterfront Action 
Committee (WAC), regarding the applicability of the HOME-SF program to a proposed project at the property at 
955 Sansome Street (Project). Your letter references previous calculations provided by Planning Department 
staff, states that you found those calculations to be incorrect for a variety of reasons and requests the Zoning 
Administrator to make a final determination on this issue and provide the associated calculations.  

Due to the subject lot’s size and location, the Project must meet the applicability requirements outlined in 
Planning Code Section 206.3(b)(8) to be eligible for the HOME-SF program:  

(8)   if located north of the centerline of Post Street and east of the centerline of Van Ness Avenue, all 
otherwise eligible HOME-SF Projects shall only be permitted on: 

(A)   lots containing no existing buildings; or 
(B)  lots equal to or greater than 12,500 square feet where existing buildings are developed to less 
than 20% of the lot’s principally permitted buildable gross floor area as determined by height 
limits, rear yard requirements, and required setbacks;

To demonstrate eligibility, the Project applicant submitted an analysis on May 6, 2022. However, that analysis did 
not account for the enclosures at the roof level, and a supplemental analysis was provided on September 14, 
2022. Both are enclosed. It is my determination that the Project meets the threshold established in Planning 
Code Section 206.3(b)(8) and is therefore eligible for the HOME-SF program. This determination is based on the 
following rationale.  

The plain reading of Planning Code 206.3(b)(8)(B) is that the development constraints considered in this analysis 
are only “height limits, rear yard requirements, and required setbacks,” and that the calculation is based on 
“gross floor area,” which is specifically defined in Planning Code Section 102. While bulk controls are considered 
in this analysis as a component of Planning Code height limits, there is no indication that any other Planning 
Code controls should be used, such as Floor Area Ratio, and they are therefore excluded. Similarly, factors like 
design and feasibility of the development are also excluded. 

It is important to note that the specific eligibility requirements of Planning Code Section 206.3(b)(8) were not 
part of the originally proposed ordinance language, and was not a recommendation from the Planning 
Commission. Instead, this additional eligibility requirement was the result of amendments made by the Land 
Use and Transportation Committee. Upon review of the recordings of the Land Use and Transportation 
Committee’s hearings where this issue was first raised and then added to the ordinance, there was no in-depth 
discussion that provided any additional guidance for this calculation beyond the Code language itself. 

Regarding the existing building, the Project applicant’s analysis indicates the gross floor area to be 33,069 square 
feet. Their analysis correctly excludes the rooftop mechanical enclosure and stair penthouse, as both are 
excluded from the definition of gross floor area. However, their analysis also excludes the mechanical space 
located at the 2nd floor, which is not a permitted exclusion from gross floor area. The 2nd floor mechanical space is 
7 feet 11 inches by 136 feet 6 inches, equaling an area of 1,088.5 square feet. Therefore, the total gross floor area 
of the existing building is 34,157.5 square feet. Please note that unenclosed roofs are excluded from the Planning 
Code definition of gross floor area, regardless of how they are accessed, or how they are used (i.e., parking, 
common open space, etc.).  

Regarding the analysis of the “principally permitted gross floor area” for development on the subject lot, the 
Project applicant’s analysis indicates a maximum of 186,666 square feet for a non-residential development. Their 
analysis accurately meets the height and bulk limits of the site, which are a maximum overall height of 84 feet (as 
measured per Planning Code Section 260) and a “E” bulk designation. The E bulk designation means that above 
a height of 65 feet, the building is limited to a maximum length of 110 feet and a maximum diagonal dimension 
of 140 feet. All the floors above 65 feet in the Project applicant’s analysis fit within these maximum permitted 
dimensions. There are no rear yard requirements or required setbacks for a non-residential development on the 
subject lot, and therefore none are considered in this analysis.  

The Planning Code requires a minimum ground floor ceiling height of 14 feet for the subject lot, with which the 
Project applicant’s analysis complies. However, the Planning Code does not include a minimum ceiling height 
above or below the ground floor, and the analysis includes floor heights of at least 8 feet 1 inch for all other 
floors, which does comply with minimum Building Code requirements. Additionally, the Planning Code does not 
regulate or limit the number of floors in new building, which is otherwise determined by other factors like height 
limits and minimum floor heights in the Planning and Building Codes. Finally, while a new development on the

subject lot could contain basement levels that would qualify as gross floor area under the Planning Code, the 
basement level in this analysis is excluded from the overall calculation.  

Based on the information provided above, the existing building’s gross floor area of 34,157.5 square feet 
represents 18.3% of the 186,666 square feet of principally permitted gross floor area for development on the 
subject lot. Therefore, the subject lot is “developed to less than 20% of the lot’s principally permitted buildable 
gross floor area as determined by height limits, rear yard requirements, and required setbacks” per Planning 
Code Section 206.3(b)(8) and is eligible for the HOME-SF program. It is noted that you call out the fact that the 
Project’s original application materials showed larger first floor dimensions for the existing building and listed 
the building as containing 36,575 square feet of floor area. However, my determination relies on the more recent 
and purposeful floor area analysis provided by the Project applicant. Additionally, even if that greater square 
footage is used in the calculation, it still represents only 19.6% of the 186,666 square feet of the 186,666 square 
feet of principally permitted gross floor area for development on the subject lot. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
