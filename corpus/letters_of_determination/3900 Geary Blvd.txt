Dear Sunny Ghai: 

This  letter  is  in  response  to  your  request  for  a  Letter  of  Determination  regarding  the  property  at  3900  Geary 
Boulevard. The request seeks confirmation of whether the proposed expansion of the current Limited Restaurant 
Formula  Retail  use  (dba  Burger  King)  into  the  adjoining  suite  (Suite  102)  would  require  a  Conditional  Use 
Authorization.  

BACKGROUND 
Your letter proposes merging the adjoining the commercial suite containing the Burger King with the adjacent 
suite to serve as additional area for refrigeration and storage for Burger King and allow a reconfiguration of the 
working area. Suite 101 is located on the ground floor, at the corner of Geary Boulevard and 3rd Avenue, is 916 
square feet in area (per submitted plans), and is currently occupied by Burger King, a Limited Restaurant Formula 
Retail use that was established prior to the adoption of Formula Retail regulations. Suite 102 is located on the 
ground floor, adjacent to Suite 101, is 386 square feet in area (per submitted plans), and is currently vacant.  

Your letter states that the new area from Suite 102 to be added to Suite 101 would be only 258 square feet. While 
your letter doesn’t address the discrepancy in the areas for Suite 102, the plans provided show that the rear wall 
adjacent to the interior hallway would be moved to match the depth of Suite 101, which would reduce the area of 
Suite 102 from 386 square feet to 258 square feet. Combining these suites as proposed would create a suite with 
an area of 1,174 square feet and would represent a 28.1% increase in area to the existing Formula Retail use.

Letter of Determination 
3900 Geary Boulevard 

Planning  Code  Section  739  regulates  the  permitted  uses  in  the  Geary  Boulevard  Neighborhood  Commercial 
District,  where  this property  is  located.  Per  Sections  739  and  703.4,  Formula  Retail  uses  are  a  conditional use. 
Planning Code Section 178(c)(1) regulates if and how conditional uses may be altered, intensified, or enlarged, 
and it states that a “permitted conditional use may not be significantly altered, enlarged, or intensified, except 
upon approval of a new conditional use application.” A Zoning Administrator interpretation from December 1998 
clarifies  what  constitutes  a  significant  enlargement  of  a  condition  use.  Part  of  that  determination  is  that  an 
expansion of a conditional use of more than 25 percent of the floor area or more than 500 square feet, whichever 
is less, constitutes a significant enlargement.  

DETERMINATION  
Based  on  the  information  above,  it  is  my  determination  that  the  proposed  expansion  of  the  existing  Limited 
Restaurant Formula Retail use at 3900 Geary Boulevard (dba Burger King) would be a significant enlargement of 
the  existing  conditional  use  pursuant  to  Planning  Code  Section  178  and  associated  Zoning  Administrator 
interpretation because it would be an increase of more than 25% of the existing floor area. As such, the proposed 
expansion would require a Conditional Use authorization per Planning Code Section 178(c)(1) and 303. If Suite 101 
was expanded by less than 25% or 500 square feet, whichever is less, then a Conditional Use Authorization would 
not be required. In either case, the expansion of the Formula Retail use in Suite 101 will require a building permit 
that will be subject to neighborhood notice per Planning Code Section 311 because it would represent a change 
of use in Suite 102 to a Formula Retail Limited Restaurant use.  

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the Zoning 
Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call (628) 652-
1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP
