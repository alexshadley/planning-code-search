Dear Mr. Hirten: 

This letter is in response to your request for a  Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1001 
Pine Street, Units 610 and 611 (Block 0275A; Lots 062 and 063). This parcel is in the RM-4 (Residential-
Mixed, High Density) Zoning District, 65-A Height and Bulk District, and Nob Hill Special Use District. 
The request is to confirm that the merger of two dwelling units (Units 610 and 611) was performed in 
accordance  with  Planning  Regulations  at  the  time  of  permit  issuance  and  completion  and  what 
further steps would be required to legally merge the two units into one single unit.  

Background 
On  November  12,  1985,  Building  Permit  Application  No.  08512848  (Permit)  was  filed  with  the 
Department  of  Building 
Inspection  (DBI)  with  the  following  project  description:  “Combine 
condominium units  610  and  611.  Interior  remodel  includes  removal  of  nonbearing  walls.  New  walls 
and  door.  Remodel  kitchen  and  bath.  Tile floor.  Misc. electrical.”  The Permit  noted  that  the  subject 
condominium  building  would  change  from  161  dwelling  units  to  160  dwelling  units.  Accompanying 
the Permit was a floor plan dated November 11, 1985, which showed the removal of one kitchen and 
non-load  bearing  walls  between  the  units,  resulting  in  a  single  dwelling  unit  comprised  of  one 
bedroom,  two  full  bathrooms,  one  kitchen,  one  living/dining  room  and  one  den.  The  Permit  was 
approved  by  the  Planning  Department  on  December  10,  1985  and  issued  by  DBI  on  December  17, 
1985. On December 1, 1986, DBI noted that all work under the Permit had been completed.   On April 
14,  2004,  DBI  issued  an  updated  Certificate  of  Final  Completion  for  the  property  under  the  Permit 
noting the building contained 160 dwelling units (as stated in the Permit). 

Planning  Code  Section  317,  which  was  adopted  by  Ordinance  69-08  on  April  17,  2008,  established 
provisions  to  require  Conditional  Use  Authorization  for  the  loss  of  dwelling  units  through  merger, 
conversion, or demolition. Per Planning Code Section 317(b)(7) and (c)(3):

1001 Pine St. #610 & #611 

(b)(7) "Residential Merger" shall mean the combining of two or more Residential or Unauthorized Units, 
resulting in a decrease in the number of Residential Units and Unauthorized Units within a building, or 
the  enlargement  of  one  or  more  existing  units  while  substantially  reducing  the  size  of  others  by  more 
than  25%  of  their  original  floor  area,  even  if  the  number  of  units  is  not  reduced.  The  Planning 
Commission may reduce the numerical element of this criterion by up to 20% of its value should it deem 
that  adjustment  is  necessary  to  implement  the  intent  of  this  Section 317,  to  conserve  existing  housing 
and preserve affordable housing. 

(c)(3)   The  Removal  of  a  Residential  Unit  that  has  received  approval  from  the  Planning  Department 
through  administrative  approval  or  the  Planning  Commission  through  a  Discretionary  Review  or 
Conditional  Use  authorization  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  Conditional  Use  requirement  of 
Subsection (c)(1) is not required to apply for an additional approval under Subsection (c)(1). 

It is noted that prior to the adoption of Ordinance No. 69-08, the Planning Commission maintained a 
series of policy directives related to the merger of dwelling units; however, none appear to have been 
in effect for the subject property at the time the Permit was reviewed or work under the Permit was 
completed.  

Determination 
Based upon information contained in your request and available City records, the merger of Units 610 
and 611 appear to have been completed with a proper City permit in compliance with then-applicable 
Planning Code requirements. The Permit for the merger of the two dwelling units was issued prior to 
the  effective  date  of  the  current  Conditional  Use  requirement  and,  therefore,  did  not  require 
Conditional Use Authorization. 

Regarding your question about steps needed to “legally merge the two units into one single unit”, no 
additional  action  is  needed  to  merge  the  units  under  the  Planning  Code  because  Building  Permit 
Application No. 08512848 served this purpose. Your request referenced existing property tax bills for 
the two separate condominium parcels. Any concerns related to property tax bills should be discussed 
with  the  Office  of  the  Assessor-Recorder  (https://www.sfassessor.org).  Any  concerns  related  to  the 
condominium process or mapping of condominium units should be discussed with the Department of 
Public Works  – Bureau of Subdivisions and Mapping (http://sfpublicworks.org/services/subdivisions-
and-mapping).  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses 
and  interpretation  and  applicability  of  the  provisions  of  the  Planning  Code.  This  Letter  of 
Determination  is  not  a  permit  to  commence  any  work  or  change  occupancy.  Permits  from 
appropriate Departments must be secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
