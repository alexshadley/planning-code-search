RH-1 Controls and State Laws 

Dear Abenet Tekie: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the permitted building envelope 
for RH-1 zoning districts and how those may be impacted by certain State laws. More specifically, your request 
includes a multi-part series of specific questions regarding height, rear yard controls, and local approval 
discretion, and how these factors are impacted by certain State laws. These questions are summarized below 
and individually answered.  

1.  Considering California Government Code Sections 65860, 66300(b)(1)(A), and 65589.5, can the Planning 
Department deny a building permit that does not comply with either the heigh limits of Planning Code 
Article 2.5, the 30% rear yard requirement adopted for RH-1 Zoning Districts in 2019 (as compared to the 
previous 25% requirement), or the Residential Design Guidelines.  

Per Planning Code Section 307(a), the Zoning Administrator has the authority and responsibility to “respond 
to all written requests for determinations regarding the classification of uses and the interpretation and 
applicability of the provisions of” the Planning Code. Under the current provisions of the Planning Code, a 
building permit that did not comply with either the height limits of Planning Code Article 2.5, the 30% rear 
yard requirement adopted for RH-1 Zoning Districts in 2019 (as compared to the previous 25% requirement), 
or the Residential Design Guidelines could be denied by the Planning Department. 

Regarding the potential impact of California Government Code Sections 65860, 66300(b)(1)(A), and 65589.5 
on the Planning Department’s ability to deny a building permit under such scenarios, please note that the 
Zoning Administrator does not have the authority or responsibility to interpret State law. Please see the 
various Planning Director Bulletins for more information on how the City currently interprets and 
implements some or all of the referenced State laws, which may be found at www.sfplanning.org. Any

dispute or final interpretation of State law would be adjudicated through the state court system.  

2.  Are the additional height controls of Planning Code Section 261(b)(1) inconsistent with the City’s adopted 
General Plan and therefore legally invalid under applicable State law to use to deny a building permit?  

The Zoning Administrator does not have the authority or responsibility to interpret the consistency or 
compliance of legislative actions with the General Plan. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors 
adopted General Plan consistency findings associated with the referenced legislative actions. Any dispute of 
such General Plan consistency would be adjudicated through the state court system.  

3.  Which elements of the General Plan are satisfied, if any, by the more restrictive 35-foot height controls of 
Planning Code Section 261(b)(1) that aren’t already sufficiently served by the 40-foot height limit?  

The Zoning Administrator does not have the authority or responsibility to interpret the consistency or 
compliance of legislative actions with the General Plan. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors 
adopted General Plan consistency findings associated with the referenced legislative actions. Any dispute of 
such General Plan consistency would be adjudicated through the state court system. 

4. 

Instead of having the separate, more restrictive 35-foot height controls of Planning Code Section 261(b)(1) 
for RH-1 Zoning Districts, why doesn’t the City instead adopt the height limit as 35 feet instead of 40 feet for 
RH-1 Zoning Districts?  

While certain height districts are more commonly combined with specific zoning districts, zoning and height 
controls are separate and do not consistently match across zoning districts. The choice to structure the 
height and zoning controls in such a manner is under the purview of the Board of Supervisors, with 
recommendation from the Planning Commission, and is not an interpretation of the Planning Code itself. 
Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is not the appropriate body to address this question.  

5.  What height limits are established in the General Plan with respect to RH-1 Zoning Districts?  

While certain height districts are more commonly combined with specific zoning districts, and while the 
Urban Design element provides guidance on building heights, the General Plan does not formally tie specific 
height district to specific zoning districts.  

6.  Why would the City simultaneously enact two inconsistent and conflicting height limits for RH-1 Zoning 

Districts?  

It is not uncommon for the Planning Code to provide multiple layers of controls, with some being more 
restrictive than others. This is especially true when one control is more broadly applied (i.e., 40-X Height and 
Bulk District) and another is more applied in a more limited/targeted manner (i.e., the 35-foot height control 
for RH-1 Zoning Districts). Regarding the question of “why,” the choice to structure the height controls in such 
a manner is under the purview of the Board of Supervisors, with recommendation from the Planning 
Commission, and is not an interpretation of the Planning Code itself. Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is 
not the appropriate body to address this question.   

7.  Ordinance No. 206-19 took effect on October 14, 2019 and, among other amendments, increased the rear

yard requirement of Section 134 from 25% of the lot depth to 30% of the lot depth for RH-1 Zoning Districts. 
Would enforcing that increased rear yard requirement violate SB 330 (Housing Crisis Act of 2019 – CA 
Government Code Sec. 66300(b)(1)(A))?  

Per Planning Code Section 307(a), the Zoning Administrator has the authority and responsibility to “respond 
to all written requests for determinations regarding the classification of uses and the interpretation and 
applicability of the provisions of” the Planning Code. Under the current provisions of the Planning Code, a 
building permit that did not comply with either the height limits of Planning Code Article 2.5, the 30% rear 
yard requirement adopted for RH-1 Zoning Districts in 2019 (as compared to the previous 25% requirement), 
or the Residential Design Guidelines could be denied by the Planning Department. 

Regarding the potential impact of California Government Code Sections 65860, 66300(b)(1)(A), and 65589.5 
on the Planning Department’s ability to deny a building permit under such scenarios, please note that the 
Zoning Administrator does not have the authority or responsibility to interpret State law. Please see the 
various Planning Director Bulletins for more information on how the City currently interprets and 
implements some or all of the referenced State laws, which may be found at www.sfplanning.org. Any 
dispute or final interpretation of State law would be adjudicated through the state court system. 

8. 

Is the failure of a building permit to meet the Residential Design Guidelines a valid basis to deny the permit 
for a lot in the RH-1 Zoning District if that permit is subject to the Housing Accountability Act (Government 
Code Sec. 65589.5)?  

See the answers to Nos. 1 and 7 above.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
