Dear John Kelvin: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 340-362 Fell 
Street. The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) that the existing two structures at 340-362 Fell Street 
are occupied by legal nonconforming Automotive Repair Use; 2) that the existing tenant spaces can be merged 
without a conditional use authorization for use size; 3) that Automotive repair includes electric vehicle service; 
and 4) that Automotive Sales is a permissible accessory use to the Automotive Repair Use.  

There are two structures on this lot that appear to be separated by fire walls but have internal connections and 
are currently occupied by three separate businesses – Domport Auto Body and Service (362 Fell Street), Fell 
Street Auto Repair (340 Fell Street), and California Detailing (340 Fell Street).  

The first question asks if Automotive Repair uses are legally established on the lot, and therefore considered to 
be legal nonconforming uses. Automotive Repair use is not permitted in the Hayes-Gough NCT District.  

Department of Building Inspection (DBI) records show that the structure at 340-350 Fell Street was originally 
constructed under Building Permit (BP) No. 105361 circa 1920 as a “public garage.” BP No. 162575 was issued in 
1927 to construct a second structure on this lot as an “addition to Fell Street Garage” and the use was identified 
as “garage.” This addition appears to be currently addressed as 362 Fell Street, although permit records are filed 
under 340 Fell Street. Subsequent BPs in the 1930s and 1940s identified the use as “garage.”  

BP No. 164390 was issued on March 27, 1956 to add a neon sign that advertised “Brakes Wheel Aligning.” The 
Planning Department approved the permit with a note stating “if brake repair and wheel aligning are incidental

to the operation of a licensed public storage garage.” This appears to be the first reference in the records to 
automotive repair activities on the subject lot.  

A span of more than 30 years passed before the next available permit record related to the use of the property. 
BP No. 572822 was issued on August 1, 1987 to install an awning and listed the existing and proposed use as 
“Automotive Repair Shop.” This permit was approved by Planning with the note “approved for awning / canopy 
only.” Subsequent BPs continued to identify the use as Automotive Repair but were not reviewed by the 
Planning Department until BP No. 713227 was issued on January 7, 1993 to reinstall a spray booth. That BP 
identified the use as “Auto Garage / Auto Body Shop” and was approved by the Planning Department.  

The Planning Department approved Miscellaneous Permit No. MB0301261 on October 21, 2003 for a “tow car 
operation permitted as an accessory use to the existing auto repair facility.”  

Prior to the subject lot’s Neighborhood Commercial zoning, which took effect in 1987, the lot was zoned C-2 
(Community Business) and Automotive Repair was principally permitted within an enclosed structure. The San 
Francisco Directory from 1977 and 1982 published by R.L. Polk & Co, and made available by the San Francisco 
Public Library, lists Standard Auto Reconstruction Inc. as being located at 340 Fell Street. Not all available 
directories were reviewed, but these samples indicate that the subject lot has been used for automotive repair 
over at least the prior 40+ years. While the permit record does not provide a distinct change of use permit, the 
overall record suggests that the Automotive Repair use was established on the lot at least as early as 1977.  

The second question relates the non-residential use size limits established in Planning Code Section 121.2. Non-
residential uses up to 2,999 square feet are principally permitted in the Hayes-Gough NCT District. A conditional 
use authorization is required for a non-residential use 3,000 square feet or greater. According to the information 
provided in the letter request, the three separate tenant spaces occupy approximately 6,500 square feet each. 
While merging the spaces into a single space decreases the number of conditional use sizes, it increases the use 
size area of one space from approximately 6,500 square feet to 19,500 square feet.   

The third question asks to confirm that the Planning Code definition for Automotive Repair includes electric 
vehicle service. Planning Code Section 102 defines Automotive Repair as follows: 

A Retail Automotive Use that provides any of the following automotive repair services, when conducted 
within an enclosed building having no openings, other than fixed windows or exits required by law, located 
within 50 feet of any R District: minor auto repair, engine repair, rebuilding, or installation of power train 
components, reconditioning of badly worn or damaged motor vehicles, collision service, or full body paint 
spraying. It may include other services for automobiles including, but not limited to, accessory towing, if all 
towed vehicles stored on the premises are limited to those vehicles that are to be repaired on the premisesʏ  

Electric vehicles are powered through a battery instead of combustible fluids like gasoline. However, they are still 
automotive vehicles with motors, brakes, exterior bodies, and other components that require repair over time.  

Lastly, you’ve asked if the proposed Automobile Sale use would be classified and permitted as an accessory use 
to the Automotive Repair use. Based on the plans submitted with the letter request, an Automobile Sale space 
approximately 5,200 square feet in area is proposed on the ground-floor, located behind the street-facing (Fell

Street) service guest and reception lounge, and would contain 2 floor model vehicles for display. This represents 
approximately 27% of the total 19,457 square foot use size.  

Planning Code Section 703(d) limits accessory uses within Neighborhood Commercial districts to no greater 
than 1/3 of the area of the principle use. Additionally, Section 703(d) specifically prohibits certain uses from 
being established as an accessory use. Section 703(d) does not prohibit Automobile Sale from being established 
as an accessory use.  

DETERMINATION 
Based on the information provided in your request, the information in the public record, and as outlined above, 
it is my determination that 1) the existing Automotive Repair uses on the subject lot are legal nonconforming 
uses that have not been abandoned or discontinued and are subject to the controls of Planning Code Article 1.7, 
2) a Conditional Use Authorization is required to combine the three separate spaces, all of which are greater than 
the principally permitted maximum use size of 2,999 square feet, because such merger would represent an 
enlargement of a conditionally permitted non-residential use size, 3) Electric Vehicle repair is consistent with the 
Planning Code definition of Automotive Repair, and 4) Automobile Sale may be considered an accessory use to 
the Automotive Repair use on the subject lot as proposed in the submitted plans, and also subject to the 
following criteria:  

A.  No additional area than what is shown may be used for the accessory Automobile Sale component of 

the use; 

B.  A maximum of 2 display vehicles are located in the sales area;  

C.  No other area other than the accessory Automobile Sale area may be used to park and/or store vehicles 

for sale or display; and 

D.  No display vehicles at the site may be used for test drives. However, test drives using vehicles stored in 

other locations may be coordinated within the Automobile Sale area. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
