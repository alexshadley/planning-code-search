Dear Barbara Schulz: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1515 Waller Street. 
The  subject  property  is  located  within  the  RH-3  (Residential,  House,  Three-Family)  Zoning  District  and  a  40-X 
Height and Bulk District. Your letter states that the ground floor commercial space at 1515 Waller Street was last 
occupied  by  a  laundry  and  dry-cleaning  business,  has  been  vacant  since  August  31,  2021,  and  you  request 
confirmation regarding what type of businesses can be established in this vacant ground floor commercial space.  

Generally, commercial uses are not principally permitted in residential zoning districts, including the RH-3 Zoning 
District. However, per Planning Code Section 209.1, Neighborhood Agriculture, Passive Outdoor Recreation, Child 
Care Facilities, Public Facilities, and Residential Care Facilities are principally permitted in RH-3, while several other 
non-residential uses are permitted with a Conditional Use Authorization (CUA).  

Additionally, the commercial use at 1515 Waller Street is considered a Limited Commercial Non-Conforming Use 
(LCU), which is allowed to continue per the controls of Planning Code Sections 186 and 183. The subject ground 
floor commercial space at 1515 Waller Street has a Planning Department record on file for the years 1919 to 1983 
as a LCU. Per this historical file, submitted documents, and other materials, the subject commercial space was last 
occupied by a Laundromat use (dba Russ Cleaners), as defined in Planning Code Section 102.

LCU Controls 
LCUs  are  permitted  within  RH,  RM,  RTO,  and  RED  Districts  per  the  more  restrictive  land  use  controls  of  the 
Neighborhood Commercial Clusters Zoning District (NC-1) or any Restricted Use Subdistricts within ¼ mile of the 
subject lot. Additionally, the subject lot is located within ¼ mile of the Fringe Financial Service Restricted  Use 
District, and those controls may be found in Section 249.35.  

Additionally, Planning Code Section 186 provides the following additional conditions for LCUs: 

•  The  building  shall  be  maintained  in  a  sound  and  attractive  condition,  consistent  with  the  general 

appearance of the neighborhood; 

•  Any signs on the property shall be made to comply with the requirements of Section 606(c) of this Code 

for Limited Commercial uses; 

•  The hours during which the use is open to the public shall be limited to the period between 6:00 a.m. 
and 10:00 p.m., however, the Planning Commission may extend the hours of operation to 12:00 a.m. 
through Conditional Use authorization, as outlined in Section 303 of this Code; 

•  Public sidewalk space may be occupied in connection with the use provided that it is occupied only 

with tables and chairs as permitted by this Municipal Code; 

•  Truck loading shall be limited in such a way as to avoid undue interference with sidewalks, or with 

crosswalks, bus stops, hydrants, and other public features; 

•  Noise, odors, and other nuisance factors shall be adequately controlled; and 
•  All other applicable provisions of this Code shall be complied with. 

CONDITIONAL USE AUTHORIZATION 
Per Planning Code Section 202.12, Conditional Use Authorization (CUA) is required for a change of use or 
demolition of a laundromat use that takes place within 3 years of the effective date of Ordinance No. 209-21, 
which took effect on December 20, 2021. The Planning Commission may consider the following criteria when 
reviewing CUA in addition to the criteria set forth in Planning Code Section 303(c): 

•  Whether  comparable  Laundromat  uses  and  services  are  available  in  the  immediate  vicinity  that  are 

accessible to seniors, people with disabilities, and other residents; 

•  Whether,  in  the  three  years  immediately  prior  to  the  date  of  the  application  for  Conditional  Use 
authorization, the rate of Laundromat closures in the immediate vicinity of the proposed change of use 
and/or citywide exceeds the rate of new Laundromat uses or equally accessible alternatives; 

•  Whether the proposed change in use would serve the essential needs of lower-income residents; and 
•  Whether the proposed change in use is in a census tract where at least 17% of the households had income 

at or below the federal poverty level. 

For the subject commercial space at 1515 Waller Street, the prior Laundromat business vacated prior to December 
20, 2021. However, such a vacation by a business does not itself constitute a “change of use” or “demolition” of the 
existing Laundromat use, as no new use was established, and the subject building was not demolished.  

Before Ord. No. 209-21 took effect, there was no separate definition for a Laundromat. Instead, it fell within the 
definition of General Retail Sales and Services (GRSS) along with various other types of retail uses like florists, 
hardware stores, book stores, gift shops, and clothing stores. Because all of those types of retail were within the

GRSS  land  use  definition,  switching  between  those  various  types  was  not  considered  a  change  of  use  (e.g., 
switching from a laundromat to a clothing store), and no change of use permit would have been required.  

Since Ordinance No. 209-21 took effect, the question of whether or not a Laundromat use had been changed to a 
new use prior to December 20, 2021 has been consistently decided by determining if both of the following are true: 

1.  The laundromat activity ceased operations prior to the December 20, 2021, and;  

2.  That another proactive step was taken prior to that date to establish a different activity or use (e.g., a new 
lease was signed for a different activity or use, a building permit application was filed for a change of use, 
etc.).  

If both of those actions did not occur prior to that effective date, then the prior Laundromat use is determined to 
still be the legal use and the CUA for Laundromat conversion applies.  In this case, no documentation was provided 
to indicate that the required second step for Laundromat conversion took place for the commercial space at 1515 
Waller Street. 

Apart from the Laundromat conversion issue, please also be aware that establishing a new Formula Retail Use (i.e., 
a chain store), as defined in Planning Code Section 303.1, would also require a CUA per Sections 303, 303.1(d), and 
710.  

DETERMINATION 
Based on the information above, it is my determination that the existing, legal use of the subject commercial space 
is a LCU Laundromat, as defined in Planning Code Sections 102 and 186. Because the Laundromat use was not 
changed or demolished prior to the effective date of Ord. No. 209-21, any change of use requires a CUA from the 
Planning Commission per Sections 202.12 and 303. The non-residential uses permitted in the subject space are 
those listed in Sections 209.1 for RH-3, and the more restrictive controls of Section 710 for NC-1 and Section 249.35 
for the Fringe Financial Service Restricted Use District. Any proposed Formula Retail use would require a CUA per 
Sections  303,  303.1(d),  and  710.  The  San  Francisco  Planning  Code  may  be  accessed  through  the  Planning 
Department’s website at www.sfplanning.org under the “Resources” tab. Please note that a building permit also 
must be filed, issued, and completed to legally establish a new use on the property.  

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
