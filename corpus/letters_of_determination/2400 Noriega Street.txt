Dear Stephen: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property 2400 Noreiga St. 
The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) Use of the church classrooms for a ministry program which 
provides academic support and enrichment activities to 56 students.  Additional information requested confirms 
that the classrooms will be used for tutoring students with their homework along with added activities like 
art/cooking/stem and music.  

Per Condition No. 9 in Motion No. 17650 adopted on July 17, 2008, “classrooms included in the project are not 
intended for general educational use.  Development of a school for general education and academic purposes 
will require amendment of this Conditional Use authorization.”  As described in your request, the classrooms are 
for general educational use and academic purposes, which conflict with the above-mentioned condition in the 
adopted motion.  As such, a new Conditional Use Authorization and a new building permit will be required.  

Please note that there is an active enforcement case (Case No. 2023-008788ENF) opened for this property.  
Please reach out to the assigned Enforcement Planner on how to address and abate the alleged violation 
of conditions of approval and next steps.   

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
