Dear Robert Bruno: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1190 Bryant Street. 
The subject property is located in the SALI (Service / Arts / Light Industrial) Zoning District, Western SoMa Special 
Use  District  (SUD), and  40  /  55-X  Height  and  Bulk  District.  The  request  seeks  confirmation  of  the  following:  1) 
whether an application to establish a Cannabis Retail use at the subject property would be eligible to proceed if 
the ownership structure is reverted back to the structure first proposed in 2016, which would not meet the criteria 
of an Equity Applicant or Equity Incubator under Section 1606 of the Police Code, and 2) whether an application 
to establish a Cannabis Retail use at 1190 Bryant Street would be eligible to proceed if the ownership structure 
was determined to meet the criteria of an Equity Incubator under Section 1606 of the Police Code. 

Planning Code Section 202.2(a)(5)(A) requires that “a Cannabis Retail establishment must apply for a permit from 
the Office of Cannabis pursuant to Article 16 of the Police Code prior to submitting an application to the Planning 
Department.”  The  Office  of  Cannabis  published  a  rule1  implementing  this  requirement  and  the  600’  rule  of 
Planning Code Section 202.2(a)(5)(B), and that rule establishes that before an applicant is eligible to apply for a 
land use authorization for a Cannabis Retail use, they must first apply for a licensing application to the City’s Office 
of Cannabis and that licensing application must be ‘referred’ to the Planning Department for review. A license will 
not be referred for review if it is within 600’ of another site that has an issued license, a license that is actively under 
review at a higher equity tier, or a license under review at the same tier that was applied for earlier. An exception 
to the 600’ buffer requirement is provided under Planning Code Section 190(b) for sites qualified as ‘Pending MCD 
Applicants’ under that Section.  

On May 23, 2017, Building Permit Application No. 201705237395 was filed to establish a Cannabis Retail use on the 
subject property. On March 29, 2019, a licensing application for a Cannabis Retail use on the subject property was

referred to the Planning Department for review. Both the building permit and licensing application are currently 
under  review.  If  the  existing  licensing  application  is  changed  and  the  referral  to  the  Planning  Department  is 
revoked by the Office of Cannabis, work on this permit will be suspended until a new referral is provided. 

There are multiple scenarios that will be possible after this time: 

1. 

2. 

If  the  other  licensing  application  that  was  submitted  within  600’  of  1190  Bryant  Street,  or  any  other 
potential applications that may be submitted within 600’ of 1190 Bryant Street prior to your new license 
application being submitted, are deemed compliant by the City’s Office of Cannabis and are referred to 
the Planning Department for review, then your licensing application will be placed on-hold by that office. 
Additional information is provided in the Office of Cannabis rule on how this would affect your application. 
One exception is if your site qualifies for an exception under Section 190(b) of the Planning Code, which is 
provided to ‘Pending MCD Applicants’. You would  need  to demonstrate that you meet the criteria of a 
‘Pending MCD Applicant’, which includes meeting the criteria of Equity Applicant or Equity Incubator. If 
your licensing application was for a non-equity, general applicant tier, then you would not qualify for this 
exemption. In this case, changing your licensing tier and causing a revocation of your referral would cause 
a disapproval of your application if another site was approved within 600’ of 1190 Bryant Street. 

If  there  was  no  other  licensing  application  submitted  within  600’  of  1190  Bryant  Street,  if  any  such 
applications  were  to  be  withdrawn  and  no  others  submitted,  or  if  such  licensing  applications  were 
deemed ineligible by the City’s Office of Cannabis and were not referred, then 1190 Bryant Street may be 
eligible for a license referral at any tier, subject to Office of Cannabis requirements. If such referral was 
provided, and if the site did not require any exemption from the 600’ rule under Section 190(b), then an 
application to establish a Cannabis Retail use would not be required under the Planning Code to meet 
any specific equity tier.  

3. 

If you are unable to meet the requirements of the City’s Office of Cannabis to obtain a new referral, then 
your application would not be eligible to proceed. 

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from  appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the Zoning 
Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call (628) 652-
1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Scott F. Sanchez 
Acing Zoning Administrator
