Dear Scott Emblidge: 

On July 17, 2019, a Letter of Determination (LoD) was issued regarding use of the sixth floor of the building at 
1040 Grant Avenue (Property). That letter did not reach a conclusion about whether the sixth floor of the 
Property could lawfully be used for financial services or commercial office space (i.e., General Office) because 
there was insufficient information regarding whether the “sixth floor has continuously operated as a financial 
service and commercial office.” This letter is in response to your request for a supplemental LoD to confirm that 
the sixth floor cannot be occupied for a financial service or General Office use. 

Your request letter provides the following additional information:  

1. 

In October 2018, the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) leased the sixth floor of the Property. Copies of 
CPA’s original lease, dated December 6, 2002 and the Third Amendment dated October 24, 2018 were 
enclosed with your request letter. 

2.  According to its website, the CPA “educates, organizes and empowers the low income and working class 

immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco to build collective power with other oppressed 
communities to demand better living and working conditions and justice for all people.” During the 
pandemic, CPA has also been packaging and preparing PPE, essential supplies and support kits for 
community members in Chinatown, including SRO residents, seniors and low-income families. 

3.  Under the lease, CPA is entitled to use the Property for, among other things, meetings, workshops and

business-related social events.

4.  CPA has been using the sixth floor of the Property for these types of activities involving CPA staff and 

members of the public. CPA facilitates community meetings, provides job training and worker organizing 
activities, and provides other social services on the sixth floor of the Property. 

Pursuant to Planning Code Section 812, Financial Services are not permitted at the second floor and above, and 
General Office use is not permitted on any floor of the Property. Planning Code Section 183(a) states, in part: 

Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, or discontinued for a continuous 
period of three years, or whenever there is otherwise evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to 
abandon a nonconforming use, such use shall not after being so changed, discontinued, or abandoned be 
reestablished, and the use of the property thereafter shall be in conformity with the use limitations of this 
Code for the district in which the property is located.  

The information provided in your request, including the leasing documents, demonstrates that CPA is a type of 
Institutional Use, and that no Financial Services or General Office use has existed on the sixth floor of the 
Property for more than three years. Additionally, the leasing documents demonstrate a clear intent of the 
property owner to use the sixth floor for a use other than Financial Services or General Office use.  

Therefore, based on the information above and included with your request, it is my determination that if any 
Financial Service or General Office use that legally occupied the sixth floor of the Property in the past, it has since 
been abandoned pursuant to Planning Code Section 183(a) and cannot be legally established on the sixth floor 
in the future unless the Planning Code is amended.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely,

'This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination to determine if the existing JP
Morgan Chase bank branch office may expand its operations to the 6t" floor of 1040 Grant Avenue.

'The subject parcel is located in the Chinatown-Residential Neighborhood Commercial District with a 50-
N Height and Bulk District. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 812.49, "Financial Service" is permitted
on the first floor with Conditional Use Authorization and not permitted on floors above. An existing
financial service use on the upper floors may be considered a legal non-conforming use and therefore,
permitted to continue as such. However, in order to be deemed a legal non-conforming use the use must
have been lawfully established at the time the law was changed to prohibit the use and the use cannot
have been discontinued or abandoned since the law was changed. To make this determination, evidence
supporting the lawful establishment and continued operation of the use must be provided.

In 1935, the property was zoned to allow commercial uses. On May 24, 1987, the Chinatown-Residential
Neighborhood Commercial District was established under Ordinance 130-87. Prior to May 24, 1987, the
subject bank was zoned commercial and was principally permitted. City records show that the above
referenced bank was constructed in 1959 and therefore, a principally permitted use at the time. While
records show subsequent office alterations on the 6t'' floor in 1961, this information is insufficient to
provide evidence of continued operation of the use as financial service or commercial office from 1987 to
present day.

Based on the records submitted, the Planning Department is unable to make a determination that the
subject propert~s sixth floor has continuously operated as a financial service and commercial office. As
such,. the Planning Department cannot confirm that the existing JP Morgan Chase bank branch may
expand its operations to the 6t'' floor of 1040 Grant Avenue. Based upon all available records and the

Planning Code, the 6t'' floor must be operated in a manner consistent with the Chinatown-Residential
Neighborhood Commercial District.
APPEAL: If you believe this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or
abuse in discretion by the Zoning Administrator, an appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals
within 15 days of the date of this letter. For information regarding the appeals process, please contact the
Board of Appeals located at 1650 Mission Street, Room 304, San Francisco, or call (415) 575-6880.
