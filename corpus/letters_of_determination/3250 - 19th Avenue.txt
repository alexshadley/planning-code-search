Dear Peter Ziblatt: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 3250 19th Avenue. 
The request seeks confirmation that a School use, meeting the Planning Code requirements for school 
certification, may re-occupy the subject property without obtaining a new Conditional Use Authorization prior to 
June 2023, including a pre-Kindergarten through 8th grade school totaling approximately 500 students. 

The property is located in the RH-1(D) zoning district, and Mercy High School operated continuously from it’s 
opening in 1952 until June 2020 when the school closed. The campus includes multiple school buildings, 
recreation facilities, and surface parking. The School use predated the Planning Code requirement for the School 
use on the property, but it obtained a Conditional Use Authorization from the Planning Commission in 1999 
(Motion No. 14769) to add a multi-purpose athletic facility building to the campus. As such, the existing legal use 
of the property is a conditional School use that is subject to the provisions of Planning Code Section 178.  

The relevant portion of Section 178 states the following regarding the abandonment of a conditional use:  

“Abandonment. A permitted conditional use that is discontinued for a period of three years, or otherwise 
abandoned, shall not be restored, except upon approval of a new conditional use application pursuant to 
the provisions of Article 3 of this Code.” 

Your request letter did not provide an exact date for when Mercy High School ceased operations, but instead 
listed it generally as June 2020. As of the date of this letter, the period of potential discontinuance of the use is

only approximately 9 months. Additionally, I am aware of no other official actions taken on the subject property 
to indicate any intent to discontinue or abandon the School use.  

Therefore, based on the information above, it is my determination that the existing conditional School use 
continues to be the legal use of the subject property, and has not been discontinued or abandoned. Another 
school may occupy and use the property as such up until the point the School use is discontinued or abandoned 
pursuant to Planning Code Section 178(d) and other relevant Zoning Administrator interpretations. Based on 
Mercy High School’s approximate cease date of June 2020, the 3-year period prescribed in Section 178(d) will not 
expire until approximately June 2023. Finally, any new school occupying the subject property is subject to the 
conditions of approval adopted pursuant to Planning Commission Motion No. 14769 and all other relevant 
Planning Code provisions and Zoning Administrator interpretations regarding the enlargement and/or 
intensification of a conditional use.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
