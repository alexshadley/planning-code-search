Dear Justin Zucker: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 1964 Post Street 
(“Subject Property”). The request seeks to confirm that the current legal use of the property under the Planning 
Code is a 12-unit residential building.  

Background 
Your request letter provides a comprehensive permit history for the Subject Property that goes back to 
demolition permit from 1910. The existing building was originally constructed as a three-story, 12-unit building 
per Building Permit (BP) No. 121238 in October 1923. Numerous building permits followed over time, some of 
which were reviewed and approved by the Planning Department, and some not. BP No. 497204 was issued in 
March 1958 for the repair of motor vehicle damage. That permit listed the number of dwelling units as 11 and 
was approved by the Planning Department, but did not indicate a merger of units.   

In June 1969, the Subject Property was issued BP No. 332966 to “remodel owner’s kitchen; new carpeting and 
cabinetry; new aluminum sash; painting exterior and interior; termite and foundation repair; plumbing and 
electrical work; sidewalk repair; and new appliances in kitchens.” The permit included a worklist attachment that 
provided a more detailed scope of work that included a section titled “Owners Apartment #3 and #4 Combined,” 
which included:  

“Remove all existing kitchen objects; remove existing partition between kitchen and hall as per sketch #2; 
remove existing wall and door between the two apartments and frame in approximately new five foot

archway as per sketch #2.” ... [the next portion of text of this section is not legible] ...and paint to match 
adjoining walls and ceilings: frame new kitchen-hall partition as per sketch #2. Remove existing door and 
partition to apartment #3 as per sketch #2.”  

You state in your request letter, and I agree, that this permit resulted in the merger of dwelling units that resulted 
in a decrease in dwelling units in the building from 12 to 11. You also note that typically the Planning Department 
must sign and approve a building permit for such a merger, but that the Planning Department instead wrote 
“N/A” on the permit to indicate their review was not required.  

While it is correct that the Planning Department would typically review and sign such a permit, it’s important to 
note that the Subject Property fell within the Western Addition A-2 Redevelopment Area when this permit was 
issued in 1969. As such, this permit was under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency 
instead of the Planning Department, and the Redevelopment Agency did indeed sign their approval to this 
permit. Additionally, there is no reason to believe that such a dwelling unit merger would have been prohibited 
at that time.  

A subsequent building permit (No. 333307) was issued in June 1969 for window installation without Planning 
Department review and listed the existing and proposed as 10 dwelling units. But thereafter, each succeeding 
building permit and Certificate of Final Completion and Occupancy (CFC) issued by the Department of Building 
Inspection (DBI) listed the building as having 11 existing and proposed units. Your request also provided the 
most recent 3R Report (Report of Residential Building Record) issued by DBI in 2021 (Report No. 202110086799), 
which understandably reflects this history by determining that the original occupancy/use was 12 dwelling units 
and the presently authorized occupancy/use is 11 dwelling units.  

Finally, it's important to note that the physical work authorized by the 1969 merger permit approved by the 
Redevelopment Agency was completed, and since that time (more than 50 years) the merged manager’s unit has 
physically existed as a single dwelling unit with a single entry and a single unit number (No. 3). There is no 
documentation indicating that the manager’s unit has been used in any way other than a single unit since the 
merger.  

Determination 
To conclude, BP No. 332966 was approved and issued in 1969 and clearly authorized the merger of 2 dwelling 
units into a single manager’s unit, resulting in a total of 11 dwelling units in the building. That Subject Property 
was not under the jurisdiction of the Planning Department at the time, and the permit was instead properly 
reviewed and approved by the Redevelopment Agency. That context has not changed since that time, the 
manager’s unit still exists as a single dwelling unit, and DBI’s 3R Report determined there to be 11 dwelling units 
on the Subject Property. Therefore, it is my determination that the Subject Property contains 11 dwelling units.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
