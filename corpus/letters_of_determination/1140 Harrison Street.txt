by the Planning Commission on April 26, 2018, as set forth in Planning Commission Motion No. 20166) to

affordable units in association with the Project, the Project Sponsor elected to pay a one-time Affordable 
Housing Fee to satisfy its Affordable Housing Program obligations. The Project is subject to a total Affordable 
Housing Fee of $31,451,315.  

The Project Sponsor acquired $31,451,315 in affordable housing credits from South Beach. The Project Sponsor 
acquired the these credits by entering into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with South Beach on 
November 5, 2018, whereby South Beach assigned the Project Sponsor the credits pursuant to the South Beach 
Project Agreement. 

The Project Sponsor then applied the entirety of the credits to the Affordable Housing Fee owed for the Project. 
The details of Project Sponsor’s election to obtain and apply these affordable housing credits is described in the 
Notice of Special Restrictions, dated October 31, 2018, recorded in the Official Records of the County of San 
Francisco on November 2, 2018 as DOC-2018-K690906-00. 

Determination  
The Project has purchased and applied the eligible credits under the South Beach Project Agreement in full 
satisfaction of its Affordable Housing Program obligations and the South Beach Project Agreement. As such, the 
Project has no additional obligations under the Affordable Housing Program.
