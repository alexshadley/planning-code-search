Dear Michelle Park: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 3325 Fillmore 
Street. The request seeks to confirm whether the development of a multi-restaurant facility with individual 
kitchens offering a variety of ready-to-eat foods for consumption on and off the premises is permitted on the 
ground and second floor of the property as a Limited Restaurant use. 

Planning Code Section 102 defines Restaurant and Limited Restaurant uses as follows:  

Restaurant. A Retail Sales and Service use that serves prepared, ready-to-eat cooked foods to customers 
for consumption on the premises and which has seating. As a minor and incidental use, it may serve 
such foods to customers for off-site consumption. It may provide on-site beer, wine, and/or liquor sales 
for drinking on the premises (with ABC license types 02, 23, 41, 47, 49, 59, 75, or 87); however, if it does 
so, it shall be required to operate as a Bona Fide Eating Place. It is distinct and separate from a Limited-
Restaurant. Such businesses shall operate with the specified conditions in Section 202.2(a)(1). 
It shall not be required to operate within an enclosed building so long as it is also a Mobile Food Facility. 
Any associated outdoor seating and/or dining area is subject to regulation as an Outdoor Activity Area as 
set forth elsewhere in this Code.

Letter of Determination 
3325 Fillmore Street 

Restaurant, Limited. A Retail Sales and Service Use that serves ready-to-eat foods and/or drinks to 
customers for consumption on or off the premises, that may or may not have seating. It may include 
wholesaling, manufacturing, or processing of foods, goods, or commodities on the premises as an 
Accessory Use as set forth in Sections 204.3 or 703(d), 803.2(d), 803.3(b)(1)(C) and 825(c)(1)(C) depending 
on the zoning district in which it is located. It includes, but is not limited to, foods provided by sandwich 
shops, coffee houses, pizzerias, ice cream shops, bakeries, delicatessens, and confectioneries meeting 
the above characteristics, but is distinct from a Specialty Grocery, Restaurant, and Bar. Within the North 
Beach SUD, it is also distinct from Specialty Food Manufacturing, as defined in Section 780.3(b). It shall 
not provide on-site beer and/or wine sales for consumption on the premises, but may sell beer and/or 
wine for consumption off the premises with a California Alcoholic Beverage Control Board License type 
20 (off-sale beer and wine), if all areas devoted to the display and sale of alcoholic beverages occupy less 
than 15% of the Occupied Floor Area of the establishment. Such businesses shall operate with the 
specified conditions in Section 202.2(a)(1). 

Pursuant to Planning Code Section 712, Restaurant and Limited Restaurant uses are principally permitted on the 
first and second stories within the NC-3 Zoning District. The Planning Code does not limit the number of kitchens 
or individual businesses that may operate within such use. However, specific plans would be required to 
determine if such an arrangement would be considered a single use, or multiple distinct restaurant uses. 
Additionally, any new restaurant businesses would be reviewed under the Formula Retail provisions of Planning 
Code Section 303.1. Please note that any use determined to be a Formula Retail use would require a Conditional 
Use Authorization from the Planning Commission pursuant to Planning Code Sections 703.4 and 712.  

Determination 
Based on the information above, it is my determination that a Restaurant or a Limited Restaurant use is 
principally permitted on the first and second floors of the subject property, with the caveat that any Formula 
Retail use would require a Conditional Use Authorization. Please note that a building permit would be required 
for the change of use.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.
