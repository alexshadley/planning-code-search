Dear Marianne Saneinejad: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 263 Lee Avenue. 
The request seeks confirmation that the property owner may retain the current legal, noncomplying rear yard, in 
connection with an anticipated development proposal that would make improvements to the existing building 
and add a second dwelling unit above the current existing dwelling unit. 

The subject property is currently developed with a one-story building that is approximately 86 feet deep. The 
subject property measures 25 feet wide and 112 feet 6 inches deep. Therefore, the property currently has a rear 
yard of 26 feet 6 inches. The subject property is located within the RH-2 District, which has a base rear yard 
requirement of 45% of lot depth, or 50 feet 7.5 inches. This rear yard requirement may be reduced down to 25% 
based on the building conditions on adjacent lots. However, the adjacent lots are not developed in a way that 
would allow for any reduction of the base 45% rear yard requirement. Therefore, the current building on the 
subject property is noncomplying with respect to the rear yard requirement, extending into the required rear 
yard setback by approximately 24 feet 1.5 inches. 

The building at 263 Lee Avenue was first constructed circa 1910 as a single-family residential dwelling unit with 
an approximate depth of 44 feet and an approximate width of 18 feet. In 1917, as documented in Building Permit 
Application (BP) No. 75280, a one-story garage addition was constructed at the rear of the building. The garage 
addition itself measured approximately 12 feet deep by 18 feet wide, bringing the total building depth to 
approximately 56 feet. Both the originally constructed building and the rear garage addition are located within 
the permitted buildable area of the lot and do not obstruct into the required rear yard. Aerial imagery taken from

1938 and a 1940 Assessor’s “building card” for the property both seem to confirm the approximate size of the 
structure at that time, roughly 18 feet by 56 feet, or 1,008 square feet. 

The next permit available in the public record is BP No. 8401648, which is also associated with Planning Case No. 
1984.252C, a Conditional Use Authorization application that sought to formally change the use of the building 
from a residential dwelling unit to a church (although the building had been used as a church without permit 
since about 1982, per the Historic Resource Assessment issued by the Planning Department on December 28, 
2020 under Record No. 2020-007600GEN) and construct a 12-foot addition at the rear of the building and an 
approximately 7-foot addition along a portion of the building’s southern façade, extending that portion of the 
building to the southern property line. 

Although the addition described in Planning Commission Motion No. 10073 appears to have been constructed, 
and there is clear evidence that the property was used as a church from approximately 1982 until about 2013, BP 
No. 8401648 authorizing this scope of work was never completed (i.e. no final inspection of the work was ever 
conducted by DBI), and the permit expired on January 23, 1985. 

It should be noted that Finding 4 in Motion No. 10073 states that prior to the proposed addition, “the site is 
presently developed with a one-story church with a 17-1/2 foot frontage along Lee avenue and a depth of 74 
feet.” This means that between the legally permitted 1917 addition (and its resulting building depth of 56 feet) 
and the 1984 Conditional Use Authorization application, there was an additional unpermitted addition made at 
the rear of the building measuring approximately 18 feet. Additionally, it should be noted that Motion No. 10073 
appears to have authorized a rear addition that could not actually have been permitted within the RH-2 District 
without the granting of a rear yard variance by the Zoning Administrator.  

As previously discussed, the subject property has a required rear yard setback of 50 feet 7.5 inches, or a 
permitted buildable lot depth of 61 feet 10.5 inches. The project approved by Motion No. 10073 would have 
resulted in a building depth of 86 feet, which would have encroached into the required rear yard by 
approximately 24 feet 1.5 inches. While Planning Code Section 136 allows for certain permitted obstructions to 
be located within the rear yard, including a 12-foot popout pursuant to Section 136(c)(25), no such permitted 
obstruction would allow for an encroachment of approximately 24 feet. 

Based on the permit history and property evidence available and described above, it is my determination that 
the legally permitted building envelope is approximately 18 feet wide and 56 feet deep, corresponding to the 
building envelope that was authorized as part of the 1917 permit and addition. As this building envelope fits 
entirely within the permitted buildable area of the lot, no portion of this would be considered noncomplying 
with respect to the required rear yard. Although BP No. 8401648 authorizing the change of use to a church was 
never completed, the property was used as a church from approximately 1982 until about 2013. However, 
because the church has not operated since 2013, the conditional Religious Institution use would be considered 
abandoned per Planning Code Section 178(d).  

Therefore, the last legal use of the building is as a residential dwelling unit. As no portion of the building is now 
considered to be legal noncomplying, any future proposal on the lot should ensure that it fully complies with the 
rear yard requirement of Planning Code Section 134 and those obstructions permitted pursuant to Planning 
Code Section 136. Any other proposed obstruction into the required rear yard will require a variance per 
Planning Code Section 305.
