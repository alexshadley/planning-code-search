Dear Samuel Ray: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 2924-2926 Cesar 
Chavez Street. The request seeks a determination of whether an Unauthorized Dwelling Unit (UDU) exists at the 
property. Per City Assessor’s records, Sanborn maps, and prior building permits, the existing building contains a 
ground floor commercial unit (2924) and a Dwelling Unit (2926) above.  

Planning Code Section 317 defines an Unauthorized Unit as:  

“…one or more rooms within a building that have been used, without the benefit of a building permit, as a 
separate and distinct living or sleeping space independent from Residential Units on the same property. 
"Independent" shall mean that (i) the space has independent access that does not require entering a 
Residential Unit on the property and (ii) there is no open, visual connection to a Residential Unit on the 
property.” Additionally, Planning Code Section 317 requires a Conditional Use Authorization for any 
Residential Conversion, defined as “the removal of cooking facilities, change of occupancy (as defined and 
regulated by the Building Code), or change of use (as defined and regulated by the Planning Code), of any 
Residential Unit or Unauthorized Unit to a Non-Residential or Student Housing use.” 

A space designated as a UDU must meet the physical requirements of the definition. The ground floor unit of the 
building located at 2924 Cesar Chavez Street has independent access through its direct access to Cesar Chavez 
Street, which does not require entering a separate Residential Unit on the property. Additionally, there is no 
open, visual connection between the ground floor unit (2924) and the Dwelling Unit (2926) on the upper floors.

Letter of Determination 
2924-2926 Cesar Chavez Street 

A space designated as a UDU must also have been used, without the benefit of a building permit, as a separate 
and distinct living or sleeping space. The Planning Department found that the ground floor unit (2924) was used, 
without the benefit of a permit, as a separate and distinct living or sleeping space. The Department’s 
determination (Record No. 2020-011870PIC) was based on the following information: 

1.  Department of Building Inspection (DBI) Complaint No. 200117319 was filed on May 10, 2001 claiming 
that the ground floor commercial space had been converted into sleeping rooms. DBI issued NOV No. 
200117319 and Building Permit (BP) No. 200109198656 was issued on September 19, 2001 to comply 
with the NOV by removing the kitchen and shower. That permit expired on March 19, 2002, but BP No. 
200304293380 was issued on June 13, 2003 and completed on June 18, 2003 to renew the previous 
permit and complete the work required to abate the NOV.  

2.  There is evidence in the records of the Rent Board from 2012 and 2014 of a residential tenancy of the 
ground floor space. Rent Board complaint records note the building as a two-unit building. Only one 
legal Dwelling Unit exists at the site per DBI records. The complaint to the Rent Board notes the unit in 
question specifically as 2924 Cesar Chavez Street, which is the address of the ground floor unit.  

On January 9, 2014 an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a decision on Petition No. T141747 
regarding 1924 Cesar Chavez Street. The decision contains a physical description of the unit in question. 
Although the complaint does not specifically note the floor level of the unit, the physical description 
matches the ground floor layout of the building and does not match the floor plan of the upper floor 
unit. The tenant and landlord parties agreed that the subject unit contained one large room, one small 
room, one living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. The plans provided show that the ground floor space 
contains one large room at the rear (including a closet space), a smaller room located directly off the 
front space, a room at the street frontage with access to the street, a full bathroom (including a shower), 
and a room labeled “mudroom” at the rear that is developed with kitchen facilities.  

Additionally, the decision substantiates that multiple units were being used as separate living spaces at 
the property, when only one Dwelling Unit was authorized. 

3.  DBI Complaint No. 201412363 was later filed on December 12, 2014 specifically for 2924 Cesar Chavez 
Street. The complaint was filed by one of the same tenants of the ground floor unit referenced in the 
ALJ’s decision noted above. The complaint was for “Water leaking through ceiling into bathroom from 
upstairs unit. Walls are damaged. No place to store garbage cans outside, owner boarded area up.” Given 
that the complaint notes water leaking through the ceiling from the upstairs unit, the complaint 
substantiates that the unit in question was at the lower floor. Additionally, the complaint substantiates 
that there are multiple units at the property, where only one is authorized. Finally, having the complaint 
filed by one of the same tenants referenced in the ALJ’s decision further substantiates that this was the 
same ground floor unit in question.  

4.  There is photographic evidence of physical improvements to the ground floor space that indicate the 

space may have been used as a residential unit. The space contains a full bathroom (including a shower) 
and a space within the rear mudroom that contains kitchen cabinetry, countertops, and an oven hood

Letter of Determination 
2924-2926 Cesar Chavez Street 

5.  Your request letter notes that a business was registered at the 2924 Cesar Chavez Street address (dba 

“Mori’s Cleaning Service”) and operated as a home cleaning service, and a copy of the Fictitious Business 
Detail from www.CRiis.com was provided. However, no other documentation was provided to indicate 
that such business every operated from the ground floor unit at 2924 Cesar Chavez Street address. 
Additionally, even if such business did operate from that unit for a period of time, that does not negate 
the other overwhelming documentation that the ground floor unit was otherwise used as a separate 
living space for a period of time.  

Therefore, based on the information above, it is my determination that a UDU does exist in the ground floor unit 
at 2924 Cesar Chavez Street. All documents referenced in this letter are part of the file for this Letter of 
Determination and are available upon request. Pursuant to Planning Code Section 317, the UDU must either be 
legalized as permitted under the Planning Code, or the property owner must obtain a Conditional Use 
Authorization from the Planning Commission per Planning Code Section 303 and obtain a building permit to 
remove the UDU from the property. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
