Impact of Ordinance No. 050-22 on Existing Group Housing 

Dear Ryan Patterson: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the impact of Ordinance No. 050-
22 on existing group housing uses in San Francisco. The request seeks confirmation whether:  

1.  Does the Ordinance’s change to the Planning Code Section 102 definition of Group Housing apply to 

existing group housing units or only newly proposed units? 

2. 

3. 

If the Ordinance’s change to the Planning Code Section 102 definition of Group Housing applies to 
existing group housing units, under what circumstances does it apply to existing units? 

In particular, does the Ordinance’s change to the Group Housing definition from “prearrangement for a 
week or more at a time” to “prearrangement for 30 days or more at a time and intended as Long-Term 
Housing” apply to existing group housing units?  

Background 
The definition of Group Housing is established in Planning Code Section 102. Prior to the adoption of Ordinance 
No. 050-22, the definition of Group Housing was as follows:  

Group Housing. A Residential Use that provides lodging or both meals and lodging, without individual 
cooking facilities, by prearrangement for a week or more at a time, in a space not defined by this Code as a 
dwelling unit. Such group housing shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, a Residential Hotel, 
boardinghouse, guesthouse, rooming house, lodging house, residence club, commune, fraternity or

Letter of Determination 
Ord. No. 050-22 & Existing Group Housing 

sorority house, monastery, nunnery, convent, or ashram. It shall also include group housing affiliated with 
and operated by a medical or educational institution, when not located on the same lot as such institution, 
which shall meet the applicable provisions of Section 304.5 of this Code concerning institutional master 
plans. 

Ordinance No. 050-22 took effect on May 1, 2022, and amended the definition of Group Housing to the following:  

Group Housing. A Residential Use that provides lodging or both meals and lodging, without individual or 
limited cooking facilities or kitchens, by prearrangement for 30 days or more at a time and intended as 
Long-Term Housing, in a space not defined by this Code as a Dwelling Unit. Except for Group Housing that 
also qualifies as Student Housing as defined in this Section 102, 100% Affordable Housing as defined in 
Planning Code Section 315, or housing operated by an organization with tax-exempt status under 26 
United States Code Section 501(c)(3) providing access to the unit in furtherance of it primary mission to 
provide housing, the residential square footage devoted to Group Housing shall include both common and 
private space in the following amounts: for every gross square foot of private space (including bedrooms 
and individual bathrooms), 0.5 gross square feet of common space shall be provided, with at least 15% of 
the common space devoted to communal kitchens with a minimum of one kitchen for every 15 Group 
Housing units. Group Housing shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, a Residential Hotel, 
boardinghouse, guesthouse, rooming house, lodging house, residence club, commune, fraternity or 
sorority house, monastery, nunnery, convent, or ashram. It shall also include group housing affiliated with 
and operated by a medical or educational institution, when not located on the same lot as such institution, 
which shall meet the applicable provisions of Section 304.5 of this Code concerning institutional master 
plans.   

It is important to note that the amended definition of Group Housing now includes specific quantitative 
requirements regarding tenure of occupancy, general common space, and communal kitchens (with some 
exceptions). Because these requirements are part of the definition of the Group Housing use, and not separate 
controls that apply to Group Housing (e.g., rear yard, exposure, etc.), they are fundamental to the use itself.  

Planning Code Section 180(a) defines a nonconforming use as follows:  

A "nonconforming use" is a use which existed lawfully at the effective date of this Code, or of amendments 
thereto, or a live/work unit which existed on the effective date of Ordinance No. 412-88 (effective October 10, 
1988) (other than a live/work unit wholly or partly occupying space whose legal occupancy under 
the Building Code was then limited to a residential occupancy) and which fails to conform to one or more 
of the use limitations under Articles 2, 6, 7 and 8 of this Code that then became applicable for the district in 
which the property is located. 

Determination 
Based on the information above, my determinations for the questions posed are as follows: 

1.  Does the Ordinance’s change to the Planning Code Section 102 definition of Group Housing apply to 

existing group housing units or only newly proposed units?

Letter of Determination 
Ord. No. 050-22 & Existing Group Housing 

The amended definition of Group Housing per Ordinance No. 055-22 applies to both existing and new 
Group Housing uses, although in different ways. The new definition applies in full to any new Group 
Housing use subject to the new definition. The new definition applies to legally existing Group Housing uses 
in that it confers on them a nonconforming use status if they do not already meet the requirements of the 
new definition or update the nonconforming Group Housing use to meet the requirements of the new 
definition. See below for more details.  

2. 

If the Ordinance’s change to the Planning Code Section 102 definition of Group Housing applies to 
existing group housing units, under what circumstances does it apply to existing units? 

Legally existing Group Housing uses that do not already meet the full requirements of the amended 
definition are considered to be a nonconforming Group Housing use, as defined in Planning Code Section 
180(a), and are subject to the applicable controls and interpretations for nonconforming uses in Article 1.7 
and other parts of the Planning Code. As such, they are permitted to continue the same legally existing 
physical and operational characteristics with no automatic requirement to update to the new definition.  

3. 

In particular, does the Ordinance’s change to the Group Housing definition from “prearrangement for a 
week or more at a time” to “prearrangement for 30 days or more at a time and intended as Long-Term 
Housing” apply to existing group housing units?  

No. Group Housing uses that legally existed when the Ordinance No. 055-22 took effect, or are otherwise 
not subject to the new definition, are allowed to continue to operate per the prior controls, which only 
required a minimum occupancy of at least one week.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not a 
permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be secured 
before work is started or occupancy is changed. 

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
