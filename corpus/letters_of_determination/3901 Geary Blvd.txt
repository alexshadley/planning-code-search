Dear Mr. Kandola: 

This  letter  is  in  response  to  your  request  for  a  Letter  of  Determination  regarding  the  property  at  3901  Geary 
Boulevard. The subject property is located in the Geary Boulevard Neighborhood Commercial District (NCD) and 
40-X Height and Bulk District. The request states that you have a 44-foot by 12-foot trailer located at the southwest 
portion of the parking lot that needs removal and that you would continue to use the lot as a vehicle sales lot with 
an  office  located  across  the  street  at  3800  Geary  Boulevard.  It  is  noted  that  Building  Permit  Application  No. 
202109108187 for the removal of the trailer has also been filed. 

Background:  
The subject property consists of three contiguous lots (Lots 001, 002, and 045 on Assessor’s Block  1541) and is 
currently used for an Automobile Sale or Rental use, which is defined in Planning Code Section 102 as a “Retail 
Automotive Use that provides vehicle sales or rentals within a building or on an open lot.” The use was authorized 
through a Conditional Use Authorization by the Planning Commission on April 9, 1964 (Resolution No. 5762 - Case 
No. CU64.9 - attached). This resolution contained eight conditions of approval that remain in effect for the subject 
property and use. Of these, condition No. 3 allowed, but did not require, an accessory structure on the subject lot.  

Based upon available aerial photography1 (attached) and permit histories, it appears that two structures totaling 
approximately  400 square feet in the form of a small office from 1965 and a modular building from 1994 (Calif 
Vehicle No. S-081-P12-4710) previously existed on Lot 001 and have been removed without benefit of a permit. 
The present modular building (which is located on Lot 045) appears to have been installed with a plumbing permit 
and without benefit of a building permit. 

1A 2009 aerial shows the 1965 building and 1994 trailer on Lot 001. A 2011 aerial shows three structures, the 1965 
building and 1994 trailer on Lot 001, and the trailer on Lot 045. A 2012 aerial shows the existing conditions with a 
trailer located on Lot 045 - the 1965 building and 1994 trailer are no longer present in this aerial.

Letter of Determination 
3901 Geary Boulevard 

Determination: 
The removal of any and all accessory buildings is permitted under Resolution No. 5762 without requiring Planning 
Commission action and would result in the Automobile Sale and Rental use remaining on the subject property. 

The Office of the Zoning administrator is responsible for enforcement of the Planning Code, including conditions 
of approval from prior Conditional Use Authorizations. In the process of researching and preparing this Letter of 
Determination, a site visit found that the subject property is presently out-of-compliance with the conditions of 
approval of Resolution No. 5762 and other City requirements. Noted items include: 

1.  Condition  No.  4  –  “The  lot  shall  be  landscaped  with  appropriate  street  trees,  along  the  Geary 
Boulevard and 3rd Avenue property lines, fences and interior planting in accordance with the site plan.” 
No interior landscaping remains, and the streets are deficient in the required trees. The 1964 plot plan 
is attached for reference. 

a.  1964 plot plan calls for a total of 12 street trees; only 6 remain.  

b.  1964 plot plan shows landscaping in two locations on Geary Boulevard, neither remain. 

2.  Aerial photography (as noted above) and permit histories show that two structures totaling 400 square 
feet, a small office from 1965 and a modular building from 1994 (Calif Vehicle No. S-081-P12-4710) had 
existed on Lot 001 and have been removed without benefit of a permit.  

3.  The present modular building on Lot 045 was installed with a plumbing permit and without benefit of 

a building permit. 

It  is  noted  that  the  unpermitted  removal  of  the  1965  building  and  1994  modular  building  likely  triggered  the 
requirements of the “Green Landscaping Ordinance” codified in Planning Code Section 142, which is required 
when  removing  or  repaving  more  than  200  square  feet  of  surface  area.  The  combined  area  of  the  removed 
structures exceeds 200 square feet; thus, it appears that such removal would have triggered the requirements of 
Planning Code Section 142.  

As noted above, the subject property is not in compliance with Condition No. 4 of Resolution No. 5762 and may 
not  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Planning  Code  Section  142.  The  subject  property  must  be  brought  into 
compliance  with  both  requirements.  To  the  extent  that  the  requirements  may  conflict,  the  more  restrictive 
requirements apply. Under separate cover, the assigned planner to Building Permit Application No. 202109108187 
will work with you to bring the subject property into compliance as well as to permit the removal of the present 
modular building. 

Separately, it is noted that a previous enforcement case from November of 2019 (Complaint No. 2019-021059ENF) 
was opened at the subject property to investigate excessive signage. The signs were removed, and the case was 
closed based on allowed signs for NC Districts in Article 6 of the Planning Code. It is noted that Condition No. 6 
contains  additional  sign  restrictions  for the  subject  property  that  must  be adhered  to,  in  addition  to  all  other 
conditions of approval.
