Dear Philip Lesser: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property located at 2740 
Mission Street. The request seeks confirmation of the following:  

1)  Whether the proposed expansion of an existing ground floor commercial space into a secondary 
tenant space located within the same building and parcel, would be defined as a Commercial 
Merger under the San Francisco Planning Code Section 754(c)(2); and, if so  

2)  Whether a Variance from the San Francisco Planning Code Section 754(c)(2) could be sought in 
conjunction with a Conditional Use Authorization to expand the existing formula retail use.  

As described in your request, Pollo Campero is a restaurant located at 2740 Mission Street. The restaurant 
occupies approximately 3,682 square feet of ground floor commercial space within a one-story, 6,250 square-
foot building with the Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 3643/005. On May 26, 2011, the Planning Commission 
approved a Conditional Use Authorization to allow Pollo Campero to operate a full-service restaurant, identified 
as a Formula Retail use, within the Mission Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District (Mission NCT). The 
adjacent tenant space, 2744 Mission Street, is located within the same building and APN and occupies the 
remaining 2,568 square feet of ground floor tenant space. As stated in your letter, 2744 Mission Street was last 
occupied by a yoga studio which aligns with the definition of a Gym in Planning Code Section 102.

Letter of Determination 
2740 Mission Street 

Both Restaurant Uses and Gym Uses are Retail Sale and Service Uses that fall under the general Commercial 
Uses definition in Planning Code Section 102. The proposition for one commercial property to absorb another 
commercial property located on the ground floor would align with the definition of a “Commercial Merger” 
under the San Francisco Planning Code Section 754(c)(2): 

“The consolidation or merger of existing ground floor commercial spaces that would result in greater 
than 1,500 gross square feet of consolidated or merged space shall be prohibited, except for Legacy 
Businesses, Arts Activities Uses, and Institutional Community Uses.” 

The proposed expansion of Pollo Campero into the adjacent tenant space will result in a commercial space of 
approximately 6,250 square feet.  As Pollo Campero is NOT a Legacy Business, Arts Activity Use, or Institutional 
Community Use, its proposed merger with the adjacent former yoga studio at 2744 Mission Street is prohibited. 

Regarding whether a Variance from Planning Code Section 754(c)(2) could be sought, Section 305 states that “no 
variance shall be granted in whole or in part which would have an effect substantially equivalent to a 
reclassification of property; or which would permit any use, any height or bulk of a building or structure, or any 
type or size or height of sign not expressly permitted by the provisions of this Code for the district or districts in 
which the property in question is located.” Since ground floor commercial space in the Mission Street NCD is 
NOT permitted to be greater than 1,500 square feet, no Variance can be granted.  

Based on the information above, it is my determination that the proposal for Pollo Campero, an existing Formula 
Retail Restaurant, to expand into the adjacent tenant space located within the same parcel would constitute a 
“Commercial Merger” and exceed the maximum allowable size of 1,500 square feet.  As specified in Planning 
Code Section 754(c)(2), this is prohibited unless the use is Legacy Business, Arts Activities Use, or Institutional 
Community Use.  Lastly, a Variance cannot be granted because the Planning Code is explicit about the size 
limitation for the Mission Street Neighborhood Commercial District and granting a Variance would essentially be 
reclassifying the property.     

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Tina Tam 
Acting Zoning Administrator
