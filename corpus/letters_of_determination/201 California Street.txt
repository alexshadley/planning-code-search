Dear John Kevlin: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination (LoD) regarding the property at 201 
California Street. The request seeks confirmation of the following: 1) that the 38,678 square foot floor area ratio 
(FAR) bonus granted as part of the building’s original approval did not require provision of the covered arcade at 
the ground floor; and 2) that the covered arcade area can be removed as part of the proposed façade redesign 
and reconfigured as interior building area without contributing to an increase for the property’s gross floor area 
(GFA).  

The subject property is a corner lot, as defined in the Planning Code, and the existing building was constructed 
in 1980 per Building Permit No. 7705017. Planning Department records indicate the project received a single FAR 
bonus. More specifically, the building received a FAR bonus of 38, 678 square feet per the provisions of Planning 
Code Section 122.3(d) in effect in 1974, which allowed for a floor area premium of 20 percent of the maximum 
FAR for corner lots. This bonus was separate from any other FAR bonuses available for such projects, and the 
project received no other FAR bonus. Additionally, there is no indication that any other conditions were adopted 
for the project to require a covered arcade be maintained at the corner of the building.  

In 2008, an LoD was issued for this property (Planning Department Case No. 7702ZAD) that determined that 201 
California Street “was granted a ‘corner bonus’ of 38,678 square feet of Gross Floor Area, apparently for providing 
covered pedestrian queuing space in the corner of the colonnade, and thus must continue to provide this 
amenity.” However, as detailed above, Planning Department records do not support this prior determination.

The proposed enclosure of covered arcade areas at the building’s ground floor, as indicated in Exhibit C of your 
request, would not increase the GFA of the building. The expansion of the existing lobby out to the property line 
would also not increase the GFA of the building because the space would be exempted from GFA calculations 
per subsection (b)(13) of the definition of Gross Floor Area in Planning Code Section 102.  

Therefore, based on the information above, it is my determination that the 38,678 square foot floor area ratio 
(FAR) bonus granted as part of the building’s original approval did not require provision of the covered arcade at 
the ground floor, and the covered arcade area can be removed as part of the proposed façade redesign and 
reconfigured as interior building area without contributing to an increase for the property’s Gross Floor Area 
(GFA) pursuant to subsection (b)(13) of the definition of Gross Floor Area in Planning Code Section 102. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
