Dear Galen Grant: 

This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property located at 65 Oak 
Grove Street. The request seeks confirmation that the intended second floor “general office” use would be 
allowed based on the property’s historical usage. The intended occupant would be the executive offices for 
District Council 16, representing union painters, glaziers, floor finishers, and drywall finishers.  

Background 
On November 21, 1986, Building Permit (BP) No. 8605886 was issued for the new construction of a warehouse 
building. On July 31, 1987, BP No. 8708959 was issued during construction to change the new use to “office.” At 
that time the lot was zoned M-1, which permitted what is today defined as General Office (Planning Code Section 
102). However, M-1 also permitted the offices of contractors as separate use. While BP No. 8708959 states “office” 
as the proposed use, it didn’t specify which type of office use. 

To help determine which type of office use was intended by BP No. 8708959, it is helpful to review other 
elements of the project. Specifically, the parking required for General Office at that time was 1 space/500 square 
feet of office. Because the project was creating nearly 10,000 square feet of office, a General Office project would 
have required 20 off-street parking spaces. However, the project only included 10 off-street parking spaces, and 
no variance was applied for or granted for providing less parking than required.  

The plans for BP No. 8708959 state that the 10 parking spaces provided were pursuant to a requirement of 1 
space/1,000 square feet, which was the Planning Code requirement for “Service, repair, or wholesale sales” use 
at that time in the Planning Code.

Letter of Determination 
65 Oak Grove Street 

On April 24, 1987, the lot was rezoned to SLI as part of the South of Market (SoMa) rezoning. That rezoning 
prohibited General Office use in the SLI Zoning District and the majority of SoMa. Additionally, the SoMa 
Planning Code amendments included the offices of contractors within the definition of a “Trade Shop” (Planning 
Code Section 890.124). Trade Shop was a permitted use within the SLI Zoning District. In 2013, the subject lot 
was rezoned to SALI, which also prohibits General Office and permits Trade Shop uses.  

The subject building’s construction was completed on March 3, 1988. All available documentation (e.g., building 
permits, sign permits, directories, internet research, etc.) indicates that all prior tenants of the subject building 
were contractor companies, including Ayoob & Peery Plumbing (the property owner of the subject lot when the 
building was constructed), Mayta Commercial, Rosendin Electric, and Sprig Electric.   

Determination 
Based on the information provided above, it is my determination that the legal use of 65 Oak Grove Street is a 
Trade Shop, as defined in Planning Code Section 890.124. A Trade Shop was principally permitted in the M-1 and 
SLI Zoning Districts and remains so within the SALI Zoning District today. Because there is no abandonment 
provision in the Planning Code for a use that is principally permitted, the Trade Shop use has not been 
abandoned and remains the legal use. The proposal to establish an office for the District Council 16 is 
considered a General Office use, which is not permitted in the SALI Zoning District per Planning Code Section 
846, and therefore cannot not permitted at the subject lot unless and until the Planning Code is amended.  

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the 
Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call 
(628) 652-1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.  

Sincerely, 

Corey A. Teague, AICP 
Zoning Administrator
