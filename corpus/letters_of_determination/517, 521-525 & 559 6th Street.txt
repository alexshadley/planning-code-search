This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the properties at 517, 521-525, and 
559 6th Street. These properties are located in the MUG (Mixed Use – General) Zoning District, Central SoMa Special 
Use District (SUD), and 55-X Height and Bulk District. The request seeks confirmation of the following: 

1.  That the existing, legal use of the buildings at 521-525 and 559 6th Street are Retail Sales and Service as 

defined under the Planning Code; and 

2.  That the existing building at 517 6th Street is not subject to Production, Distribution, and Repair (PDR) land 

use replacement controls pursuant Planning Code Section 202.8 (Proposition X). 

Property Description and History 
The buildings at 517, 521-525, and 559 6th Street are located on the east side of 6th Street between Bryant and 
Brannan Streets in the MUG Zoning District and Central SoMa Special Use District on three separate parcels in 
Assessor’s Block 3778:

research. The building contains approximately 11,450 square feet and was originally industrial in use,

517, 521-525, and 559 6th Street

559  6th  Street  is  located  on  Lot  017  and  was  constructed  circa  1906.  The  building  contains 
approximately  15,434  square  feet  and  was  originally  used  as  a  warehouse  for  Burns  &  Meighan, 
wholesale tea and coffee distributors. 

As noted in the request letter, the current property owner first established a retail use at 521 6th Street in 1963 (d.b.a. 
“Angray  Merchandising,  Inc.”),  expanding  into  559  6th  Street  in  1965.  These  properties  have  had  an  internal 
connection  and  have  been  used  as  one  Retail  Sales  and  Service  use  (d.b.a.  “Fantastico,”  a  party  supply  and 
costume store) since approximately 1973, resulting in a total use size of approximately 26,884 square feet. The 
property at 517 6th Street was purchased by the owner of Fantastico in 1975 and operated as a separate retail space. 

All three parcels were zoned M-2 (Heavy Industrial) when they were purchased by the current owner in the 1970s. 
In 1990, the South of Market Area Plan was adopted by the Board of Supervisors (BOS File No. 115-90) and the 
subject  parcels  were  re-zoned  to  SLI  (Service  Light  Industrial).  In  2013,  the  parcels  were  re-zoned  to  SALI 
(Service/Arts/Light Industrial) upon adoption of the Western SoMa Area Plan. In 2019, the parcels were re-zoned 
to MUG upon adoption of the Central SoMa Area Plan and were included within the Central SoMa Special Use 
District. 

Land Use: 521-525 and 559 6th Street 
At the time Fantastico was established, the M-2 Zoning Districts explicitly excluded “residential uses…schools, 
hospitals,  and  other  institutions  for  human habitation  or  care”  and  explicitly permitted  any  “retail  business  or 
personal service establishment, not limited to sales or services primarily for residents in the immediate vicinity, 
and not restricted to the sale of new commodities.”  1  As a party supply and costume store open to the public, 
Fantastico qualified as a retail business establishment at the time it was established at 599 and later 521-525 6th 
Street and was therefore a principally permitted use in an M-2 Zoning District. Similarly, Retail Sales and Service 
Uses (as defined in Section 890.104) remain a principally permitted use in the current MUG Zoning District. 

As noted in the Letter of Determination request, while both 521-525 and 559 6th Street include a permit history 
documenting  the  existing  retail use,  none  of  the  permits  appear  to  document a  change  of  use  (with Planning 
Department  approval)  from  the  previous  industrial  use  to  the  current  retail  use.  That  said,  Building  Permit 
Application No. 9704634 (for seismic retrofit of 521-525 6th Street) did receive a Certificate of Final Inspection (CFC) 
from the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) on December 3, 1997. More recently, the Planning Department 
approved Building Permit Application No. 202012181361 for 521-525 6th Street and Building Permit Application No. 
202012211384 for 559 6th Street and both permits noted the retail use of the properties. 

In light of the use and permit history for 521-525 and 559 6th Street, the amount of time passed, and the fact that 
the use complied with Planning Code requirements in effect at the time the use was established and generally 
remains in compliance with current use requirements, the legal use of these properties can be identified as a single 
General Retail Sales and Service Use greater than 25,000 square feet.

Letter of Determination 
517, 521-525, and 559 6th Street 

PDR Replacement Controls: 517 6th Street 
Planning  Code  Section  202.8  places  limitations  on  the  conversion  and/or  demolition  PDR  uses  pursuant  to 
Proposition X (a 2016 ballot measure). Per Section 202.8(d), PDR replacement generally applies for conversion of 
building space where the prior use of such space was at least 5,000 square feet of PDR use, at least 2,500 square 
feet of Institutional Community use, or any amount of Arts Activity. While the building at 517 6th Street appears to 
have consistently contained land uses that would be classified as PDR (other than Arts Activity), the building itself 
contains only 4,449 square feet total according to the San Francisco Assessor. As such, the building is not subject 
to the controls of Section 202.8. 

Please  note  that  a  Letter  of  Determination  is  a  determination  regarding  the  classification  of  uses  and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not 
a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.  

APPEAL:  An appeal may be filed with the Board of Appeals within 15 days of the date of this letter if you believe 
this determination represents an error in interpretation of the Planning Code or abuse in discretion by the Zoning 
Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call (628) 652-
1150, or visit www.sfgov.org/bdappeal.
