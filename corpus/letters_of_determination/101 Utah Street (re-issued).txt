Dear John Kevlin: 

This letter is being re-issued to address factual errors contained in the original letter issued on September 8, 
2022. This letter is in response to your request for a Letter of Determination regarding the property at 101 Utah 
Street. The request is to release the property from Conditions of Approval related to off-street parking under 
Variance Case Nos. 1982.232V and 1986.35V. There is no record that the Conditions of Approval for Case No. 
1982.232V were ever recorded. However, the Conditions of Approval for Case No. 1986.35V were recorded in 
Notice of Special Restrictions (NSR) Document No. D823408. 

The property was constructed as a warehouse in 1957 and remained in that use until 1982, when it was 
converted to a Wholesale Sales use. At that time, the Planning Code required the Wholesale Sales use to provide 
38 off-street parking spaces. On July 26, 1982, the Zoning Administrator granted a Variance under Case No. 
1982.232V with the following condition:  

…That at least 13 off-site spaces shall be based on the adjacent Lot 3 or on another property within 800 
feet walking distance from the mail entrance to the building on this site and that the owner shall agree to 
participate in any planning studies or construction of parking garages designed to provide a joint solution 
to parking problems of the neighborhood. The leased parking shall be paved and made usable under 
appropriate permits prior to issuance of permits for conversion of the building. 

In 1986, an accessory office use totaling 1,928 square feet was added to the existing Wholesale Sales use, which 
in turn required an additional two parking spaces under the Planning Code at that time. On June 12, 1986, the

Zoning Administrator granted a variance under Case No. 1982.232V. Conditions of Approval Nos. 1-6 of the 
variance approval included various requirements related to the provision of off-street parking for the Wholesale 
Sales use at off-site locations, as follows:  

1.  That two leased parking spaces be provided as per parking plan shown as Exhibit B dated May 6, 1986 and 
attached to leased parking agreement with Caltrans dated March 19, 1985. The two (2) off-street parking 
spaces shall be designated solely for the property use. 

2.  That when the applicant's lease expires, the applicant shall replace the lease with another lease or· 

ownership of a site which can accommodate 2 parking spaces, which is approved by the Department of 
City Planning, and is within 800 feet of the subject property. Applicant is responsible for providing two (2) 
parking spaces for the lifetime of the use on building. 

3.  That applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator in writing an annual update on January 31, of 

every year for the lifetime of the use on building verifying that the parking as required under Variance No. 
86.35V is hereby [met]. 

4.  That failure of applicant to provide 2 leased parking spaces within eight hundred feet (800) of the subject 

property shall require the reduction of 1,928 square feet of occupied accessory office space to be converted 
to storage space or non-occupied space. 

5.  That notice of the off-street parking requirement be given to the public and tenants of the building through 
notices, lease agreements and a plague displayed on the building in a manner approved by the Zoning 
Administrator. Applicant shall also submit to the Zoning Administrator for review and approval a copy of 
the draft tenant lease agreement. 

6.  That in the event that the City is required to bring and prevails in a legal action to enforce the terms of this 
variance, the applicant or its successors and assigns shall pay to the City the City's costs and expenses 
incurred to enforce the terms of this variance, including a reasonable attorneys' fee and expert witness 
fees. 

In 2008, the adoption of the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plan and association Planning Code and Zoning Map 
amendments resulted in the property’s rezoning from M-1 (Light Industrial) to PDR-1-D (Production, Distribution, 
and Repair – 1 – Design). Per Planning Code Section 151.1, accessory off-street parking is not required in the 
PDR-1-D Zoning District, and there is instead a parking maximum. 

Based on the information above, in your request, and in City records, it is my determination that the conditions 
of approval of Variance Cases 1982.232V and 1986.35V pertain only to the provision of off-street accessory 
parking per the parking requirements in place at that time. All conditions of approval of the variance approvals 
per Case Nos. 1982.232V and 1986.35V related to the provision of such parking are no longer valid. A “Release of 
Notice of Special Restrictions” will be provided separately and may be recorded on the subject property to nullify 
the off-street accessory parking conditions contained in NSR Document No. D823408. 

Please note that a Letter of Determination is a determination regarding the classification of uses and 
interpretation and applicability of the provisions of the Planning Code. This Letter of Determination is not

a permit to commence any work or change occupancy. Permits from appropriate Departments must be 
secured before work is started or occupancy is changed.

Zoning Administrator. Please contact the Board of Appeals in person at 49 South Van Ness Ave, Suite 1475, call
