gpt4_pairs = {
    'Q: Under Section 250(e), how does the provision of Article 2.5 apply '
    'to properties and developments in San Francisco?':
        'A: The provision of Article 2.5 applies to all properties and developments,'
        ' both public and private, in San Francisco, including those owned by the City and County of San Francisco.',

    'Q: In the context of Section 251, what specific urban design goal does the establishment of '
    'height and bulk districts serve related to the character of existing development?':
        'A: The establishment of height and bulk districts aims to relate the height of new buildings '
        'to the height and character of existing development, ensuring new constructions harmonize with '
        'the existing cityscape.',

    'Q: According to Section 252, how are the classes of height and bulk districts determined and indicated?':
        'A: The classes of height and bulk districts are determined and indicated on the Zoning Map, '
        'with height limits specified numerically in feet and bulk limits designated by letter symbols '
        'referring to limitations on the plan dimensions of buildings.',

    'Q: Section 253 outlines specific review processes for buildings exceeding certain heights in various '
    'districts. Can you identify a unique condition that triggers a different review process in this section?':
        'A: A unique condition triggering a different review process is in RM or RC Districts with more '
        'than 50 feet of street frontage on the front fa√ßade, subjecting buildings over 40 feet in height '
        'to the conditional use requirement.',

    'Q: Analyze Section 260 and explain the method of height measurement for lots that slope upward from '
    'a street. How does this differ from measurement on level lots?':
        'A: For upward sloping lots, the measurement point is taken at curb level for the closest part '
        'of the building within 10 feet of the street property line, with additional points taken as the '
        'average ground elevations at building cross-sections. This contrasts with level lots, where the '
        'point is taken at curb level on the street at the building centerline.',

    'Q: In Section 261, what additional height limits are applied to RH-1(D), RH-1, and RH-1(S) Districts, '
    'and how are they determined?':
        'A: In RH-1(D), RH-1, and RH-1(S) Districts, additional height limits are applied based on the average '
        'ground elevation difference between the front and rear lot lines. For example, the permitted height '
        'increases to 40 feet if the rear lot elevation is 20 or more feet higher than the front.',

    'Q: Describe the purpose of the additional height limits for Narrow Streets and Alleys in Section 261.1 '
    'and how they contribute to the character of these areas.':
        'A: The purpose is to preserve the intimate character of Narrow Streets and Alleys by limiting building '
        'heights to ensure they are not overshadowed or overcrowded, thus maintaining ample sunlight and air, '
        'contributing to the unique character of these areas.',

    'Q: Section 263 provides for special exceptions to height limits. Can you elaborate on a scenario where '
    'these exceptions might be applied and the conditions that must be met?':
        'A: Special exceptions to height limits might be applied in designated height and bulk districts where '
        'buildings exceeding prescribed limits can enhance urban design or serve public interest. Conditions '
        'include Planning Commission approval and adherence to conditional use procedures in Section 303.',

    'Q: Under Section 260(b), what are the criteria for exempting certain building features from height limits, '
    'and how is the total permissible exemption area calculated?':
        'A: Certain building features like mechanical equipment and elevator penthouses are exempt from height '
        'limits, subject to limitations like maximum heights and footprint. The total permissible exemption '
        'area is calculated as a percentage of the roof area, with variations depending on the district and '
        'specific building characteristics.',

    'Q: Explain how Section 261.2 addresses the balance between development heights and the pedestrian '
    'environment along Folsom Street in the Folsom Street NCT District.':
        'A: Section 261.2 focuses on balancing appropriate development heights with maximizing light and '
        'air to sidewalks, parks, and frontages along Folsom Street. It mandates a 15-foot setback for '
        'building portions above 55 feet from property lines fronting Folsom Street, ensuring a high-quality '
        'pedestrian environment while allowing for development.'
